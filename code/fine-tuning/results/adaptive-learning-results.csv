0,"Doctor: Hi there, what brings you in today?
Patient: Hey doc, I've been having this intermittent lower abdominal pain, burning micturition, and a weird lump in my abdomen for the last three months.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me where exactly the lump is located?
Patient: Sure, it's on my right side, in the lumbar region.
Doctor: Okay, let's take a closer look. Oh, I see it now. The lump moves on inspiration and measures about 3.7 cm by 2.6 cm. Let's run some tests to see what's going on.
Patient: Yeah, that sounds good.
Doctor: Your renal function tests show that everything is within the normal range. However, the abdominal ultrasound reveals a calculus measuring about 2 cm by 1.8 cm in the renal pelvis, and mild hydronephrosis on your right side. We also noticed that your left kidney is not in its usual location, but rather, there's a second kidney on your right side, fused to your right kidney.
Patient: Oh wow, that's strange.
Doctor: Yes, it's quite unusual. We performed a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of your abdomen, which confirmed our findings from the ultrasound.
Patient: So what does that mean exactly?
Doctor: When we administered an intravenous non-ionic contrast agent, we noticed that there's a single ureter draining the collecting system of both your kidneys and opening into your urinary bladder on the same side. Your left ureter is absent. Additionally, we observed a subtle thickening of your urinary bladder wall.
Patient: What about blood supply?
Doctor: The fused kidneys are supplied by two renal arteries originating from your left internal iliac artery. A three-dimensional volume-rendering technique shows that there's a single renal vein draining the fused renal parenchyma into the inferior vena cava. And as I mentioned earlier, there's a single ureter draining the crossed fused kidneys into your urinary bladder on the same side.
Patient: Are there any other abnormalities?
Doctor: We didn't see any associated congenital skeletal abnormalities. However, we would like to keep you under follow-up, as cases like these may show malignant transformation in the future.
Patient: Oh, okay. I understand.
Doctor: Don't worry, we'll keep a close eye on your condition and ensure you receive the best possible care. Just make sure to attend your follow-up appointments.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","ancreas, and gallbladder. These lesions are spread throughout your body, including the lower abdomen, pelvic cavity, and sacrum.
Patient: How did they get here?
Doctor: The first indication was a suspicious appearance on your physical examination, followed by a CT scan showing a single ureter drainage system on your left side with no evidence of obstruction. It wasn't until several weeks later when we started performing regular surveillance imaging studies using fluoroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Patient: And then how did things progress?
Doctor: Over time,"
1,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doc. I've been having worsening left flank pain for about a year now, along with some visible blood in my urine sometimes. I also feel a fullness in my left flank.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
Patient: Yes, I've had a loss of appetite and I've lost a lot of weight. I've also been treated by my local doctor for recurrent urinary tract infections.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Let's start with a clinical examination. *performs examination* I can feel an ill-defined mass in your left flank, and it seems to be causing you pain on palpation.
Patient: Ouch, yeah that's the spot.
Doctor: We will need to do some laboratory work and an abdominal CT scan to get a better understanding of what's going on. *conducts tests* The lab work shows a normocytic, normochromic anemia, but the rest is unremarkable. However, the CT scan reveals a large soft tissue mass measuring about 108x106x105 mm in your left kidney.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds bad.
Doctor: It's concerning, but we need more information. The ureter and renal artery are poorly visualized, and the renal vein is not well demonstrated. However, there's no evidence of metastatic spread to your adrenal glands, lymph nodes, liver, or chest. We also didn't find any bladder lesions during the cystoscopy.
Patient: So what's the diagnosis, doc?
Doctor: Based on these findings, we have a tentative diagnosis of RCC, stage cT3aN0M0. Our plan is to perform a hand-assisted laparoscopic radical nephrectomy to remove the affected kidney.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: Intraoperatively, we found a large left lower pole renal mass and a bulky, dilated proximal ureter. We decided to proceed with a radical nephrectomy and ureterectomy. The ureter was mobilized and divided at the level of the pelvic brim.
Patient: Did you find any enlarged lymph nodes during the surgery?
Doctor: No, we didn't find any enlargement of lymph nodes on preoperative imaging or when we palpated them intraoperatively. As a result, we didn't perform a lymph node dissection.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: Your postoperative course went smoothly, and we were able to discharge you four days after surgery. We'll continue to monitor your recovery and follow up with any necessary care.
Patient: Thank you for all your help, doc. I appreciate it.","teratoma or teratoid rhabdoid tumor.
Patient: Is there anything else we should know?
Doctor: You mentioned losing a lot of weight after being referred to us, correct? We performed a serological test using a routine kit, which came back positive for hepatitis a virus antibodies and negative for human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, and syphilis. Additionally, we did a whole genome sequencing analysis of your bacterial colonization samples obtained"
2,"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented to the ED with six episodes of left-sided headaches in the past two and a half weeks. Can you tell me more about the symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having photophobia, nausea, and vomiting along with the headaches.
Doctor: I see. It seems like you've had some improvement in your symptoms with the use of medications such as prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, and ketorolac. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, those medications have been helping me feel a bit better.
Doctor: You've also had multiple evaluations in the ED, including a negative head computed tomography (CT) and negative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We've provided you with prescriptions for medications that were helpful in the ED, but you keep returning with a headache. Is that right?
Patient: Yeah, the headaches just don't seem to go away.
Doctor: Have you had any history of migraines prior to your first presentation?
Patient: No, I've never had migraines before.
Doctor: Hmm, we initially labeled your condition as ""migraines"" and treated you repeatedly with ""migraine cocktails."" During your last visit, you were seen about two hours before shift change, and you were reported to be alert, oriented, and with a Glasglow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I remember.
Doctor: After that visit, you received prochlorperazine, diphenhydramine, and ketorolac and were signed out as “a migraine, medicated, discharge pending improvement.” However, when you were examined after sign-out, you appeared drowsy, presumably due to prochlorperazine and diphenhydramine. Is that correct?
Patient: Yeah, I was feeling really drowsy.
Doctor: You were then put under observation in the ED, and three hours after medication administration, we conducted frequent examinations. During those examinations, your GCS was 10, and you never returned to your neurologic baseline per your family at the bedside. Can you confirm that?
Patient: Yes, my family mentioned that I wasn't acting like myself.
Doctor: Your family also noticed that you were answering questions about your history incorrectly and displaying a change from your ""normal"" effect. Is that right?
Patient: Yeah, they said I was acting strangely.
Doctor: Initially, your diagnosis was a migraine headache, and we provided treatment for that. However, when we discovered you had an altered mental status instead of just being drowsy from the medication, we expanded the differential diagnosis. We'll continue to evaluate your condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Please keep us informed of any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns.
Patient: Okay, thank you for your help, Doctor.","romptly.
Patient: That sounds serious. What should I expect while I'm in the hospital?
Doctor: The primary goals of treatment will be to prevent further complications from developing. We will monitor you regularly through regular follow-ups and assess your progress over time. Your physical therapist has already started working with you to improve functional mobility and reduce pain associated with your neck pain.
Patient: And how"
3,"Doctor: Hi there, can you please tell me what brought you in today?
Patient: Hi, I suffered from chest tightness seven months ago and was admitted to the hospital.
Doctor: I see. Did you have any tests done at that time?
Patient: Yes, the echography demonstrated that I had severe aortic and mitral valve regurgitation.
Doctor: How were you treated for that?
Patient: I had an open cardiac aortic valve replacement with a biological valve, 25#, Edwards, and a mitral valve repair.
Doctor: And how was your recovery after the cardiac procedure?
Patient: During the sixth-month follow-up, chest radiographs revealed suspected intimal patches of aortic arch and descending aorta. The thoracic aortic angiography showed an aortic dissecting aneurysm.
Doctor: Oh, I see. Were there any indications of what might have caused the dissection?
Patient: The doctors said it was about 4 cm above the coronary ostium, where the aortic cannula was placed. They thought it might be due to inappropriate string technique in surgery.
Doctor: I understand. And how were you feeling at that time? Any chest pain, tightness, syncope, nausea, or vomiting?
Patient: No, I didn't have any of those symptoms.
Doctor: What happened after that?
Patient: I received conservative medical treatment for one month, then came to your department for further treatment.
Doctor: And what treatment did you receive here?
Patient: I underwent endovascular stent-graft implantation and in situ laser fenestration for revascularization of aortic arch.
Doctor: Can you please tell me about the procedure?
Patient: A femoral vein-bilateral carotid bypass was established by femoral vein and bilateral carotid cannulation with 20 F and 12-16 F catheter sheaths. A stent release system was introduced, and the stent was released after my systolic blood pressure was reduced to 90 mmHg.
Doctor: How was the laser fenestration done?
Patient: The laser catheter was introduced through the left carotid artery, directly contacting the endograft membrane as perpendicularly as possible. Fenestration was made by applying 0.5 J energy with a holmium laser at a frequency of 5 Hz. Then, they did 4-mm balloon dilation and introduced a 0.035-in. stiff guidewire into the endograft lumen to introduce a bare stent.
Doctor: And was the same procedure performed for the left carotid artery and left subclavian artery?
Patient: Yes, the same procedure was done for both arteries.
Doctor: How long did the operation take?
Patient: The operation was completed within 4 hours, and the time of extracorporeal circulation was 56 minutes.
Doctor: How has your recovery been since the procedure?
Patient: I recovered without any clinical complications and was discharged five days after the procedure.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Make sure to continue with your follow-up appointments to monitor your progress. If you experience any symptoms or have any concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.","stroke. However, they were"
4,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've come to the emergency department because I've been experiencing atraumatic pain in my neck and shoulders, along with a fever for the last 4 weeks.
Doctor: I see. Can you please tell me a bit about your medical history?
Patient: Sure. I have arterial hypertension and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPDD) disease, which I manage with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. I don't have any medical family history, and I've never had any surgical interventions. Oh, and about 6 months ago, I had infective endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but that was successfully treated with medical treatment.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. How was the infective endocarditis diagnosed?
Patient: It was diagnosed by suggestive findings on a transesophageal echocardiogram and isolation of MRSA on two consecutive blood cultures.
Doctor: I understand. Did you require any operative treatment for your infective endocarditis?
Patient: No, because I had moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, the cardiothoracic surgery team said that no operative treatment was necessary.
Doctor: What was the medical treatment you received for the infective endocarditis?
Patient: I was given intravenously administered antibiotics using a combination of vancomycin at 30 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks and gentamicin at 3 mg/kg per day for 5 days.
Doctor: Thank you. And how did you respond to the treatment?
Patient: I became afebrile from the third week of antibiotherapy, and my C-reactive protein (CRP) was negative at the last week of antibiotherapy.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, at the current presentation, I noticed during the physical examination that you have a painful and tender swelling over your right sternoclavicular joint (SCJ), and the overlying skin is stretched and shiny. Your rectal temperature is 39 °C, and there's a moderate decrease in your right shoulder's range of motion. Your cardiac auscultation doesn't reveal any added sounds or abnormalities. We also conducted laboratory investigations that showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 107 mm at the end of 1 hour, and a CRP at 222 mg/l.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed computed tomography (CT) scans that revealed destruction of the medial extremities of your two clavicles and bilateral collections in the soft tissues around the SCJs. Magnetic resonance imaging will be necessary for further evaluation.
Patient: What should I do now, doctor?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and discuss the appropriate course of action based on the results of the magnetic resonance imaging. Please follow up with us regularly and let us know if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new symptoms.
Patient: Okay, thank you for helping me, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions.",
5,"Doctor: Good morning, sir. I understand you have a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and angina. Can you tell me about your current symptoms?
Patient: Good morning, doc. Yeah, I've been feeling really weak and lethargic lately. I also have cold intolerance, weight loss, and loss of appetite.
Doctor: I see. Are you a smoker?
Patient: Yes, I've been smoking a half-pack per day for 47 years.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me when these symptoms started?
Patient: Hmm, I think about one and a half months prior to my admission here. I became really lethargic and lost my appetite. I lost about 7 kg in just one month.
Doctor: That's quite a significant weight loss. On the day of your admission, how were you feeling?
Patient: I couldn't even move because of my overall weakness and lethargy. My family had to transfer me to your hospital.
Doctor: When you arrived at the hospital, were you conscious and oriented?
Patient: Yes, I was.
Doctor: I see that your blood pressure was low (104/70 mmHg) compared to your previous hypertension, and your blood glucose was also low (64 mg/dl). Your body temperature was 35.8 °C, heart rate 60 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. Did you notice any conjunctival pallor or thyromegaly?
Patient: No, I didn't notice anything like that.
Doctor: Your cardiac and pulmonary examination results were normal, other than a positive tilt test. On your neurological examination, there were no visual defects and your higher cognitive functions were normal. We also conducted some laboratory studies. Your complete blood count and coagulation were normal.
Patient: Okay, that's good to hear.
Doctor: Your biochemistry tests showed a sodium level of 134 mEq/L, which is slightly below the reference range of 135-147 mEq/L, and hypoglycemia. However, your other electrolytes were within normal limits. We also checked your thyroid levels. Your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.505 μIU/ml, free thyroxine (FT4) was 0.61 ng/dl, and free triiodothyronine was 1.67 ng/dl. These levels are outside the reference ranges.
Patient: What does that mean, doc?
Doctor: These results suggest that your thyroid function may be contributing to your symptoms. We also performed an electrocardiogram, which showed a sinus bradycardiac rhythm. This means your heart rate is slower than normal.
Patient: Oh, I see. What should we do now, doc?
Doctor: We'll need to further investigate your thyroid function and consider appropriate treatment options based on the findings. In the meantime, we'll closely monitor your blood pressure, blood glucose, and other vitals. We'll also provide you with guidance on managing your symptoms and improving your overall health. Please make sure to follow up with us as instructed.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doc.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you feel better. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.",
6,"Doctor: Hello, I've reviewed your history and it seems like you've been experiencing a cough with mucous-purulent sputum and dyspnea for the past four weeks. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, that's correct. I've been having this cough and some difficulty breathing, but I don't smoke and haven't been around any substances that I know of that could cause lipoid pneumonia.
Doctor: I see. Your past medical history is negative for exposure to such substances. You mentioned that you worked in a cotton factory for a few years, but apart from that, you haven't travelled recently or had any pets, right?
Patient: That's correct.
Doctor: You have been treated for atrial fibrillation with amiodarone for 30 years, along with systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypothyroidism, is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: During your physical examination, you appeared well built and nourished with a pulse rate of 69 per minute and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Your vital signs were within normal range with an SpO2 of 95% in room air. We did notice bibasal lung crackles, but there was no evidence of pallor, icterus, cyanosis, clubbing, or lymphadenopathy. 
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: Your blood work-up was within the normal range. However, the pulmonary function testing demonstrated moderate restrictive lung disease and a decreased diffusion capacity. We also conducted a chest X-ray which showed bilateral infiltrates.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: To further investigate, we performed a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) which revealed areas of ground glass appearance, particularly in the lower lobes of both lungs, and airspace consolidations were seen as well. Interestingly, the shadows improved 2 years later.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We considered several possibilities like atypical pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, and tuberculosis, but TB was ruled out. We also had you undergo a fiberoptic bronchoscopy for bronchial wash and bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) collection for immunological studies.
Patient: What did the results show?
Doctor: The bronchial washings were sent for smear for acid fast bacilli and cytological examination. No microorganisms were isolated by bacteriological examination and no malignant cells were found. The total cell count of the BALF was 287,500/ml, consisting of macrophages (64%), lymphocytes (31%), neutrophils (3%), and eosinophils (2%).
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: The results suggest that you have a non-infectious lung condition, and we'll continue to monitor it closely. We'll also adjust your treatment plan as needed to manage your symptoms effectively.
Patient: Alright, thank you for the information, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Take care!","551 ul. Blood cultures grew gram-negative rods, and your"
7,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you were diagnosed with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (T2N0M0) at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Kyushu Hospital, in November 2016. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Were you treated for pulmonary TB when you were 18?
Patient: Yes, I was.
Doctor: Okay, so during your examination, thoracic computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) showed no thoracic abnormalities, right?
Patient: Yes, that's what they said.
Doctor: You underwent radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer at 70 Gy (35 fr), and the tumor disappeared. However, in April 2017, a primary lesion recurrence with laryngeal edema and cervical lymph node metastasis were observed. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, unfortunately.
Doctor: While waiting for surgery, you were administered steroid (prednisolone) for 1 month, with the dose starting at 60 mg and being reduced gradually, with the aim of alleviating the edema. Is that right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: In May 2017, you had a total laryngectomy and bilateral cervical lymph node dissection. How was your recovery after the surgery?
Patient: It was a bit rough. I developed a fever and had some trouble breathing.
Doctor: I see that a thoracic X-ray 2 weeks before surgery in May 2017 revealed a small amount of pleural effusion. The amount of pleural effusion increased immediately after surgery, and by the following day, you had developed a fever of 39 °C. They initially considered your condition to be pleural effusion associated with pneumonia due to general bacteria, and sulbactam/ampicillin and meropenem were administered, but your symptoms didn't improve. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what happened.
Doctor: Pleural fluid analysis showed that lymphocytes were present, which decreased the concern for bacterial infection. They then considered the possibility of TB, so sputum smear tests, including rapid molecular diagnostic testing for TB using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were conducted five times. However, the results were negative. Is that right?
Patient: Yes, they couldn't find anything in those tests.
Doctor: Eventually, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in a solid medium (""Ogawa"" medium) culture test after 3 weeks. You were considered to have TB pleural effusion, and TB treatment was initiated. How has your treatment been going since then?
Patient: It's been going alright. I've been taking the anti-TB drugs they prescribed.
Doctor: Great, so you've continued to receive treatment with anti-TB drugs, which are rifampicin (RFP), isoniazid (INH), and ethambutol (EB). It's important that you continue to take these medications as prescribed and inform me of any changes in your symptoms or side effects you may experience. We will monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment as needed. Do you have any questions or concerns about your treatment?
Patient: No, I think I understand everything. Thank you for explaining it all to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. I'm here to help and support you throughout your treatment. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Take care and stay in touch.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.",
8,"Doctor: Hi there, I hope you're doing well today. I understand that you underwent SMILE for myopia in both eyes back in June 2013 when you were 19 years old. Can you tell me if you've had any issues with your vision since then?
Patient: Hi doctor, thanks for asking. I haven't had any major complaints about my vision.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, I see that you have a history of eye rubbing and allergic conjunctivitis. Have you been experiencing any of those symptoms recently?
Patient: Yes, I still have eye rubbing and sometimes I get episodes of allergic conjunctivitis.
Doctor: I see. It's important to note that before your SMILE procedure, you had no history of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration and no family history of keratoconus or high myopia. Your preoperative characteristics and parameters are summarized in Table, and your preoperative topographies are presented in Fig. Your manifest refraction values were -6.75 DS with 1.00 DC × 45 in the right eye and -6.75 DS with 0.75 DC × 140 in the left eye, and your corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/20 in both eyes.
Patient: Hmm, yes, that's correct.
Doctor: One month after your SMILE procedure, your uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) was 20/20 in both eyes, which is great. However, corneal topography revealed corneal ectasia. Posterior elevation was +21 μm in both eyes, and respective thinnest corneal thicknesses (TCTs) were 433 mm and 429 mm in the right and left eyes. The pachymetry examination showed a decentred elevation coincident with the thinnest point on the posterior surface.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: At 7.5 months, topography indicated posterior elevation of +29 μm in the right eye and +31 μm in the left. Respective TCTs were 445 mm and 426 mm in the right and left eyes.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: At 14 months after SMILE, your UDVA had reduced to 20/32 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left. As you mentioned, you still have eye rubbing and intermittent episodes of allergic conjunctivitis after SMILE. 
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: To address this issue, simultaneous PTK and CXL (PTK + CXL) was performed in both eyes. Before CXL, the central 9.0-mm was assessed.
Patient: Got it.
Doctor: It's very important that we continue to monitor your vision and eye health, as well as manage your allergic conjunctivitis. Please make sure to attend your follow-up appointments and let me know if you have any concerns or notice any changes in your vision.
Patient: Sure, I'll make sure to follow up with you, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me.","(SGUs) were used to cover approximately 6 cm².

9,"Doctor: Hello there, what brings you to the surgical outpatient department today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having this perineal swelling for quite some time now. I noticed it about 6 months ago, and it's in the right perineal region.
Doctor: I see. Can you describe the swelling for me? How large is it?
Patient: It's about the size of a lemon. It hasn't really increased in size over the past months.
Doctor: Okay, and is the swelling painful? Have you noticed any changes in the overlying skin colour or texture?
Patient: No, it's painless and there haven't been any changes in the skin colour or texture.
Doctor: Alright. Based on your complaints, I think we should refer you for an MRI examination to check for a possible lipoma in the soft tissues. 
Patient: Okay, sure.
(After the MRI)
Doctor: I have the results of your MRI here. We carried out the examination before and after administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast. The MRI revealed a well-encapsulated lesion measuring 36 × 26 × 24 mm in the subcutaneous soft tissues of the perineum on the right side.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: The lesion appears as a low signal intensity on T1 weighted images, intermediate signal intensity on T2 weighted images and heterogeneous high signal intensity on proton density fat-saturated images. The lesion showed restricted diffusion with low signal intensity on apparent diffusion coefficient images and high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images. Post-contrast images demonstrated subtle enhancement of the lesion wall, with no abnormal internal enhancement.
Patient: So, is it a lipoma?
Doctor: Based on the MRI features, we can rule out the clinical diagnosis of a lipoma. Instead, we suggest that it is an epidermoid cyst.
Patient: What's the next step then?
Doctor: We will perform surgical excision of the swelling. After that, the specimen will be sent for histopathology to confirm the diagnosis.
Patient: Alright. I hope it's not something serious.
(After surgery and histopathology)
Doctor: Good news! The histopathology report confirmed that the swelling is indeed an epidermoid cyst, and there is no evidence of malignancy.
Patient: Oh, that's a relief! Thank you, doctor.","king for many years.

Has anyone else in the family reported similar symptoms?"
10,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you were treated for fever, mild cough, and nasal discharge at another hospital. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with influenza A infection and they treated me with oseltamivir for 5 days. But my condition got worse, I started feeling more fatigue, low activity, and breathing difficulty.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. You mentioned that you were admitted to our hospital 7 days after your initial diagnosis. Have you had any history of recurrent bacterial infections or growth failure?
Patient: No, I haven't had any such issues before.
Doctor: Okay, let's discuss your physical examination at admission. It showed remarkable respiratory distress and consciousness disturbance (Glasgow Coma Scale, E4V3M4). Your body temperature was 38.0°C, blood pressure was 126/77 mmHg, heart rate was 155 beats/min, respiratory rate was 60 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 90% at room air. We also noticed reduced right breath sounds and detected an end-inspiratory crackle in your right upper lung. Moreover, you had red, cracked lips, strawberry tongue, and trunk and bilateral feet erythema. There was no bilateral conjunctival injection, cervical lymphadenopathy, or edema. 
Patient: Hmm, that sounds concerning.
Doctor: Yes, and your laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 20,000/μL with 95.1% neutrophils, hemoglobin level of 14.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 22.7 × 104/μL. Inflammatory biomarkers were elevated; C-reactive protein level was 20.54 mg/dl, procalcitonin level was 45.23 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 512 U/L, ferritin level was 261 ng/mL, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level was 6,176 U/mL. The levels of several cytokines were also increased: IL-1β was 1.3 pg/mL; IL-6 was 233 pg/mL; IL-10 was 67 mg/mL; and TNF-α was 2.6 pg/mL. 
Patient: So what does all that mean, doc?
Doctor: These results indicate a significant inflammatory response in your body, likely due to the influenza A infection. This could be the reason for your deteriorating condition, fatigue, and breathing difficulty. 
Patient: What should I do now?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and adjust your treatment accordingly. Your medical team will provide the necessary care and support to help you recover. It's crucial for you to follow your doctor's instructions and attend any follow-up appointments to track your progress.

11,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you presented to a local hospital with upper and lower extremity motor disturbances back in 2014. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, I had some weakness and numbness in my arms and legs. They did some tests and found a mild reduction in my nerve conduction velocity. They diagnosed me with polyneuropathy.
Doctor: I understand. In 2016, you experienced 3 episodes of pleurisy with fever, with a body temperature greater than 38°C, occurring at 2-month intervals. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It was quite painful and the fever was pretty high.
Doctor: I see that you were referred to our hospital in June 2017 because you tested positive for both myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA and proteinase-3 (PR3)-ANCA. Are you aware of your family medical history?
Patient: My family history is unremarkable. I don't drink, but I have smoked 20 cigarettes a day for 25 years.
Doctor: I also see that you have been taking 50 mg/day of losartan and 5 mg/day of amlodipine for hypertension. Since 2006, you've been treated with 100 mg/day of PTU for hyperthyroidism. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: During your first visit to our hospital, we conducted a laboratory test which showed the following results: white blood cell count at 3980/μL, C-reactive protein (CRP) at 1.39 mg/dL, MPO-ANCA at 10.20 EU/L, and PR3-ANCA at 6.76 EU/L. We suspected PTU-associated AAV, so we discontinued your PTU treatment. How did you feel after discontinuing PTU?
Patient: Well, the CRP levels normalized, but the numbness in my limbs didn't improve.
Doctor: In November 2017, you were admitted to our hospital with chest pain and high fever. Your body temperature was 37.8°C and your blood pressure was 158/109 mm Hg. Can you describe your state of consciousness at that time?
Patient: I was fully conscious and aware of everything happening around me.
Doctor: Did you have any neurological, respiratory, or abdominal involvement during that time?
Patient: No, I didn't experience any issues with those.
Doctor: Were you experiencing any pleural friction rubs, or unusual sounds when you breathed?
Patient: No, I didn't notice any strange sounds.
Doctor: How was your manual muscle strength at that time?
Patient: It was normal, I didn't have any issues with my muscle strength.
Doctor: During your admission, we conducted another laboratory test. The findings were as follows: white blood cell count at 6760/μL, CRP at 8.65 mg/dL, creatine kinase at 512 U/L, PR3-ANCA at 6.88 IU/mL, and MPO-ANCA at 12.7 IU/mL. We also performed a computed tomography scan. Based on these results, we will continue to monitor your condition and work on a treatment plan to address your symptoms. Please make sure to come in for regular follow-up appointments and let us know if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new symptoms.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and will make sure to follow your instructions.",
12,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I was diagnosed with left breast cancer and I'm considering my options for reconstruction.
Doctor: I see. One option for reconstruction is bilateral autologous breast reconstruction. This involves using your own tissue to create new breasts. Have you heard of this procedure before?
Patient: Yes, I've heard of it, but I'm not sure about the details.
Doctor: Let me explain the procedure. Intraoperatively, we place the patient in lithotomy position, which means you'll be lying on your back with your legs elevated. We'll draw skin paddle fleur-de-PAP patterns on both thighs to indicate where the tissue will be taken from. The tissue is then elevated using incisions and dissection, and the dominant perforators, which are the blood vessels that supply the tissue, are identified.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We'll then make additional incisions and harvest the flaps, which are the pieces of tissue we'll use for the reconstruction. These flaps will be anastomosed, or connected, to the internal mammary artery and vein in your chest. This ensures proper blood flow to the new breast tissue.
Patient: So, how do you make sure the new tissue has enough blood supply?
Doctor: We use a technique called fluorescence imaging to confirm that the perfusion, or blood flow, to the skin paddle is adequate. This is a critical step to ensure the success of the procedure.
Patient: I see. And how much tissue would you use for the reconstruction?
Doctor: The final flap weights for a typical procedure are around 316 grams for the right side and 298 grams for the left side, with each flap measuring approximately 22 cm by 7 cm.
Patient: Alright, what happens after the surgery?
Doctor: During your follow-up appointments, we'll monitor your recovery. In some cases, patients may experience minimal dehiscence, which is a small separation at the incision site. This can be treated with silver nitrate applications.
Patient: And what about esthetic procedures?
Doctor: Yes, once you've healed, you can undergo second-stage esthetic procedures for contouring. This may involve excising the skin paddle, fat grafting for volume in the superior pole, which is the upper part of the breast, and nipple tattooing. For example, we might add 140 mL of fat to the right breast and 80 mL to the left breast.
Patient: Are there any complications with these esthetic procedures?
Doctor: Generally, these procedures are well-tolerated and have minimal complications. Our goal is to help you achieve the most natural and satisfying results possible.
Patient: Thank you for explaining everything. I'll think about it and discuss with my family.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout this journey.",
13,"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you've been hospitalized for several months due to bipolar disorder. What brings you here today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing atypical vaginal bleeding for over a year now, and it has worsened over time.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We will need to conduct some tests to find the cause of this bleeding. 
(After running tests)
Doctor: We conducted an abdominal CECT which showed a large pelvic mass. Given the complexity of your case, you were transferred to our institution for further evaluation. A pelvic MRI revealed a bulky mass in the whole uterine corpus, which has spread to the bladder and rectum. Additionally, chest and abdominal CECT revealed multiple lymph node metastases, extending from the para-aortic to pelvic lymph nodes.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: We also performed endometrial curettage, which showed atypical cells arranged in sheets with numerous mitotic figures. There was no sarcoma component, and the histological pattern indicated a carcinoma. ER and PR tumor cells were focally expressed. 
Patient: What does that mean for me, Doctor?
Doctor: As for tumor markers, we found elevated levels of CA19-9, CEA, and SCC (CA19-9 at 43 U/ml, CEA at 13.9 ng/ml, and SCC at 80.4 ng/ml). CA125 and CA72-4 levels were within normal range (CA125 at 12 U/ml and CA72-4 at 2.5 U/ml). 
Patient: So, what's the diagnosis?
Doctor: Although the pathological diagnosis remains uncertain, based on the overall findings, you have been diagnosed with stage IVA uterine endometrial cancer.
Patient: That's terrible. What can we do about it?
Doctor: Due to the presence of your mental disorder and poor general condition (performance status 4), the optimal treatment for you is best supportive care.
Patient: I understand. What can I expect in terms of prognosis?
Doctor: Unfortunately, the prognosis is not favorable. The patient in this case passed away three months after the diagnosis. The autopsy revealed uterine tumor invasion to the bladder, rectum, and pelvic wall with the involvement of the greater omentum and small intestine. Metastases to the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes were observed. Microscopically, endometrioid carcinoma (grade 2) and undifferentiated carcinoma components were present. Pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3) was diffusely expressed in the differentiated carcinoma component and focally expressed in the undifferentiated carcinoma component.
Patient's family member: Thank you for your honesty, Doctor. We will do our best to support her through this difficult time.","nce any concerns or require additional consultation, don't hesitate to reach out.

14,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 26-year-old male non-hypertensive patient. Can you tell me why you were hospitalized on August 11, 2016?
Patient: Yes, I was hospitalized because of my 8-year history of elevated SCr, and I've been on maintenance HD for 7 years.
Doctor: I understand. I can see that the next day you were transplanted with a deceased kidney donor due to your preoperative SCr of 893 umol/L and BUN of 27.32 mmol/L (shown in Additional file: Figure S2). Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Following the transplantation, you received standard triple immunosuppression as well as regular follow-up assessments, correct?
Patient: Yes, I did.
Doctor: It seems that Cyclosporine A (CsA) was substituted for Tac in your treatment plan, but your renal graft still gradually developed DGF with SCr of 534 umol/L and BUN of 30.06 mmol/L (Additional file: Figure S2). Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what happened.
Doctor: I see that on post-op day 38, a USG-guided renal biopsy was employed (Fig. b). The biopsy detected deposition of diffuse CaOx crystals as well as acute TCMR (2015 Banff 2A) in the renal graft (Fig. c, 200X HE and polarized light). However, there were no oxalate crystals in the ZHIB. Can you confirm this?
Patient: Yes, that's what the biopsy found.
Doctor: Molecular genetic testing was conducted and identified two mutations in the AGXT gene: exon 1: c.33dupC (p. Lys12fs), frameshift PV; and exon 2: c.215A > T (p. Asn72Ile), missense VUS. Additionally, one mutation in the MUT gene (Exon11: c.1897G > C (p. Val633Leu), missense VUS) was detected. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with PH1. Does that sound accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's the diagnosis.
Doctor: It appears you were treated with PN (400 mg, iv, QD) and temporary intensive HD for your PH1. Can you confirm this?
Patient: Yes, that's the treatment I received.
Doctor: Lastly, I noticed that you were dealing with anemia as well, with hemoglobin levels (HGB) ranging from 57 to 62 g/L. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I've been struggling with anemia.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. We will continue monitoring your condition and adjust your treatment plan as necessary. It's important to keep up with your follow-up assessments and report any new symptoms or concerns to your healthcare team. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to keep in touch with my healthcare team and follow up as needed.","those doses looked like?

15,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: My 1-year-old son recently developed a fever, and I noticed some skin eruptions on his body. He seems to be unwell.
Doctor: I see. Let's examine him further to determine the cause of his symptoms. We'll run some tests to check for any abnormalities.
(After running tests)
Doctor: The test results show that your son has hepatoplenomegaly, which is an enlargement of the liver and spleen, as well as pancytopenia, a decrease in all types of blood cells. We also found hyperferritinemia, with a level of 5,181 ng/ml, and an elevated soluble IL-2 receptor at 6,797 U/ml.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What could be causing all this?
Doctor: We checked for anti-EBV antibodies, which indicated a primary infection of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). High EBV loads were detected in your son's peripheral blood and CD8+ T cells, with 1 × 10^5 copies/ml and 1 × 10^6 copies/μgDNA, respectively. These findings led us to diagnose him with EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH).
Patient: What about his NK-cell activity?
Doctor: His NK-cell activity is at 30% lysis, which falls within the normal reference range of 18-40%.
Patient: What's the treatment plan for my son?
Doctor: We treated your son with two courses of etoposide injections at a dose of 100 mg/m2 to control the relapsing HLH. We also administered immunomodulation therapy using high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, oral cyclosporine, and prednisolone.
Patient: Did the treatment work?
Doctor: Yes, after the immunochemotherapy, the circulating levels of the EBV genome became undetectable, which is a positive sign. We also performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of your son's peripheral blood-derived DNA and determined a hemizygous variant of the XIAP gene (c.1045_1047delGAG, p.Glu349del).
Patient: So, how is my son doing now?
Doctor: Your son is alive and well at 7 years of age, without any sequelae or dysgammaglobulinemia. We also checked the numbers of CD19+IgD−CD27+ switched memory B cells and CD4+CD45RA−CXCR5+ follicular helper T cells, and they were not decreased, as shown in the data.
Patient: That's great news! Thank you so much, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or notice any changes in his health, don't hesitate to contact us. We'll continue to monitor his progress closely.",
16,"Doctor: Hi there, I see you were admitted to our hospital complaining of abdominal pain that has persisted for 3 days. How are you feeling now?
Patient: Hi doctor, the pain is still there, and it's quite uncomfortable.
Doctor: I understand. You seem alert and not pale, which is a good sign. Your blood pressure is at 112/70 mmHg, and you have a regular pulse of 78 bpm. We've also conducted some laboratory tests. Your white blood cell count is 7530/μL, hemoglobin concentration is 11.0 g/dL, platelet count is 249,000/μL, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase concentration is 22 IU/L, glutamic pyruvic transaminase concentration is 9 IU/L, and lactic dehydrogenase concentration is 259 IU/L.
Patient: Okay, but what does all that mean?
Doctor: These numbers indicate that you're in a stable condition, but we needed to investigate the cause of your abdominal pain. We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed a 10 × 10 × 10-cm low-density area in your mid-abdomen. Then, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and found a large abdominal cystic lesion.
Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning.
Doctor: It's definitely something we need to address. Interestingly, the tumor position differed notably between the CT and MRI scans, which led us to suspect an unfixed, mesenteric cystic lesion. As a result, we decided to perform a single-port laparoscopic-assisted resection instead of a conventional laparotomy.
Patient: What does that involve?
Doctor: A single-incision access platform and wound protector were introduced through a 1.5-cm transumbilical skin incision. During the laparoscopy, we found a large cyst derived from the greater omentum. We moved it to a position under the umbilical wound.
Patient: How did you remove it?
Doctor: We aspirated the cyst fluid, which was serous in nature, using a tissue adhesive called Dermabond, a suction tube with negative pressure, and a 16-gage over-the-needle catheter and syringe. This reduced the size of the tumor, and none of the cyst fluid was released into the abdominal cavity.
Patient: That's a relief. What was the diagnosis?
Doctor: The tumor was successfully removed via the small incision and was diagnosed histopathologically as a cystic lymphangioma.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: The surgery was uneventful, and your postoperative recovery has been normal so far. Intraperitoneal cystic tumors like yours are quite rare, but we're confident that we've addressed the issue.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'm glad the procedure went well and that I'm on the road to recovery.",
17,"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of prostate cancer. What brings you here today?
Patient: Hi, Doc. I've been having black stools for a day and even had an episode of syncope recently.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms like nausea or poor appetite?
Patient: Yes, actually. I've been feeling nauseous and lost my appetite for the last four weeks. I even lost fifteen pounds in the past six months without trying.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We ran some tests, and your initial lab workup showed a low hemoglobin level at 11 mg/dL and an elevated serum creatinine of 14.83 mg/dL, which is much higher than your baseline of 1.00 mg/dL. Your urinalysis also eluded to a large amount of dysmorphic red blood cells, 2+ urine protein, but no evidence of an underlying urinary tract infection (UTI).
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed a renal ultrasound, which ruled out obstructive uropathy as the cause. You underwent two separate sessions of hemodialysis, which brought your serum creatinine levels back to baseline.
Patient: Okay, that's a relief.
Doctor: Given your prior history of prostate cancer, we did a non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It revealed new osteoblastic lesions in your L2 vertebra and an asymmetrical thickening of the bladder wall, which is concerning for a recurred metastatic disease.
Patient: Oh, no. What does that mean for me?
Doctor: During your admission, you frequently passed melanotic stools, which led to a second syncopal episode and a drastic decline in your hemoglobin levels to 6 mg/dL. You were then transferred to our medical facility for further management.
Patient: What happened next, Doc?
Doctor: You were initially transfused with two units of packed red blood cells. Following that, you underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a non-bleeding duodenal ulcer. We remedied it with bipolar cautery and clipping.
Patient: I'm glad that was taken care of.
Doctor: After the EGD, you were noted to have shortness of breath (SOB). We did a subsequent chest CT scan without contrast, which revealed emphysematous changes in bilateral lung fields, with interstitial fibrosis and nodular formations.
Patient: What does all this mean for my health, doctor?
Doctor: Your current predicament is concerning, but we will continue to monitor and manage your condition. We'll work closely with you to develop an appropriate treatment plan and ensure you receive the necessary care.

Patient: Hi, I have been experiencing lower back pain for about two years now, and it's been getting worse.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me when this pain started and what might have caused it?
Patient: Yeah, the pain started when I tried to pick up some heavy luggage two years ago.
Doctor: Have you been taking any medications or tried any home remedies for the pain?
Patient: Yes, I have been taking over-the-counter pain medication and using a hot water bottle on the painful area. It provided some symptomatic relief.
Doctor: How long have you been using the hot water bottle, and do you sleep with it?
Patient: I've been using the hot water bottle for the past few months, and I used to sleep with it underneath my body.
Doctor: Have you noticed any skin changes on the area where you apply the hot water bottle?
Patient: Yes, actually. I developed erythema ab igne, and it started to itch. Over the next few months, the area developed hyperpigmentation.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. We will need to investigate this further with x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to better understand what's going on with your back. *After tests* The MRI revealed L4-L5 and L5-S1 disc bulges in your spine.
Patient: What does that mean, and how can it be treated?
Doctor: We can treat the disc bulges with a transforaminal nerve block (TFNB) injection, which should provide reasonable relief. However, please be aware that the lumbar spine pathology may require surgery later in your life.
Patient: Okay, I understand. What about the skin issue?
Doctor: I advise you to stop using the hot water bottle immediately. I will refer you to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment of the erythema ab igne and hyperpigmentation.

Patient: Yes, it started after I had a session of acupuncture and cupping ('ba guan') at a traditional medicine practitioner to treat my long-standing neck pain and intermittent numbness and tingling of both hands.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of medical conditions?
Patient: I had De Quervain's tenosynovitis of the left hand, which was released seven years ago. And I'm a non-smoker.
Doctor: Okay. Did the chest pain occur while you were sitting down after receiving the treatment?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I didn't have any trauma to my chest, but I did have some difficulty taking in breaths because of the pain.
Doctor: Do you have any fever, cough, runny nose, or sore throat?
Patient: No, I don't have any of those symptoms.
Doctor: Alright. Based on your physical examination, you were afebrile, had a blood pressure of 99/63 mmHg, a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. You appeared alert, comfortable, and able to speak in full sentences. Your heart sounds were normal, and your breath sounds were slightly decreased on the right side. We also inspected your back and found multiple cupping and needling marks. Your abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no pedal edema.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We conducted some initial investigations, including a normal complete blood count and metabolic panel. Your electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST segment or T wave changes.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: However, the chest radiograph taken upon admission revealed a right-sided pneumothorax with an apical-cupola distance of 3.6 cm.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there is air in the space between your lung and chest wall, causing your lung to collapse partially. This could be the cause of your chest pain and difficulty breathing.
Patient: What are the next steps, then?
Doctor: We have put you on a non-rebreather mask with a FiO2 to help you breathe better. We will observe your condition closely and decide on further treatment if necessary.

Patient: I've had no period for about 5 weeks and 4 days now.
Doctor: I also see that you underwent intrauterine insemination (IUI) 27 days ago. Can you tell me about the process you went through for that?
Patient: Sure. I had ovarian hyperstimulation with Clomiphene citrate 100 mg daily during the 3rd to 7th days of my cycle, followed by 75 IU hMG daily on the 7th to 9th days. A transvaginal ultrasound showed four dominant follicles in my left ovary after the stimulation.
Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Now, during the physical examination, we found that you had normal vital signs but also diffuse lower abdominal tenderness. We also checked your serum beta-chorionic gonadotropin level, which was 3154 mUI/mL.
Patient: Oh, okay. What does that mean?
Doctor: It can be an indicator of pregnancy. We performed a transvaginal ultrasound and found a large hyperechoic mass, suspected to be a hematoma, in the cul-de-sac. It also showed a normal-sized uterus without an intrauterine gestational sac, endometrial thickening of 20 mm, and both right and left adnexa appeared normal on the ultrasound.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: Your initial complete blood count showed a hematocrit of 35.9%, hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dL, white blood cells at 9.3 × 109/L, and platelets at 252 × 109/L.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: Based on these results, our provisional diagnosis is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum. We performed an emergency laparoscopy to further investigate.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it can be. Intraoperatively, we found a dark blood clot of about 800 ml along with a small amount of fresh blood. We also discovered an approximately 2 × 2 × 1.5 cm unruptured ectopic pregnancy in your right fallopian tube, while the left fallopian tube appeared normal.
Patient: What about my ovaries?
Doctor: While examining your ovaries to locate the cause of the bleeding, we observed minimal bleeding from the proximal pole of the left ovary, where there was a 1.0 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm hemorrhagic mass with surrounding tissue.
Patient: What are the next steps for me?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your condition and provide appropriate treatment to address the ectopic pregnancy and bleeding. It is essential for you to follow up with us regularly to ensure your recovery and discuss any further concerns you may have.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll definitely look into it and figure out what's going on. In the meantime, we need to admit you into the intensive care unit for closer monitoring.
Patient: Okay, that sounds serious. What will you be doing there?
Doctor: We'll be initiating renal replacement therapy, specifically continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), to address your anuric AKI. We'll also be conducting a thorough laboratory examination.
Patient: What are the results of the laboratory examination?
Doctor: Your lab results showed that you have thrombocytopenia and Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. Your hemoglobin level is 3.7 mmol/L, platelets are 118 × 109/L, haptoglobin is less than 0.1 g/L, fragmented erythrocytes are at 1%, and lactate dehydrogenase is higher than 13 mmol/L. However, your ADAMTS13 levels and activity are normal, at over 50%, and there are no ADAMTS13 autoantibodies.
Patient: Oh, that sounds complicated. What does that all mean?
Doctor: It means that we need to do further Complement analysis and a percutaneous kidney biopsy to determine the cause of your symptoms. The analysis showed reduced levels of C3 (0.5 – 0.7 g/l; reference range: 0.8 – 1.6) and normal levels for C4. The kidney biopsy showed signs of acute and non-acute preglomerular and intraglomerular TMA.
Patient: What's the plan for my treatment, then?
Doctor: We'll start you on intravenous glucocorticoids and 6 weeks of plasma exchange. However, your condition will only improve after we add a C5-inhibitor called eculizumab. You'll receive 4 weeks of induction followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy.
Patient: Will my condition get better after that?
Doctor: Yes, your condition will slowly resolve, and you'll achieve complete hematological and clinical remission. Your kidney function will gradually recover over several months, allowing us to terminate hemodialysis.
Patient: What about my long-term prognosis?
Doctor: Long-term follow-up over 6 years showed no relapse and stable renal function at CKD stage 3, which means your kidneys are functioning at 40-50 ml/min/1.73 m2 according to the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) guidelines. You won't require continued maintenance therapy.
Patient: That's a relief. What caused all of this in the first place?
Doctor: We performed targeted next-generation sequencing using a gene panel consisting of 14 aHUS-associated genes. We identified a novel heterozygous canonical splice site variant in the CFH gene as the cause of your condition.
Patient: Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. I feel much better knowing there's a plan for my treatment and recovery.",

Patient: Yeah, I've been having these headaches on and off for a while now. They just come and go randomly.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed an MRI and a CT scan, and it appears there's a space-occupying lesion at your sella turcica, measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.3 cm (Fig. A, B).
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean?
Doctor: This lesion is actually a pituitary macroadenoma, which is a type of tumor. It's the likely cause of your headaches and your acromegaly.
Patient: Acromegaly? What's that?
Doctor: Acromegaly is a condition where the body produces too much growth hormone. We conducted preoperative endocrine examinations and found that your growth hormone levels are elevated. 
Patient: So, what's the treatment for this?
Doctor: The best course of action is to undergo endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery to remove the tumor. We employed 3D-printing technology to reconstruct a model of your tumor (Fig. C, D).
Patient: Wow, that's interesting. What's the purpose of the 3D model?
Doctor: We used the model to actively communicate your condition with your relatives, which led to good communication results. It also helped us plan the surgical approach and practice the surgical manipulation, providing important guidance for the surgery.
Patient: That's really helpful. So, how did the surgery go?
Doctor: The surgery went well, and we were able to achieve a full tumor resection. The pathological examination confirmed that the tumor was a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma.
Patient: That's great to hear. Were there any complications after the surgery?
Doctor: No complications occurred after the surgery, and you're on track for a successful recovery. We'll continue to monitor your progress as you prepare to be discharged.

Doctor: We'll need to take your son to the operating room to address this issue. Under local anesthesia and loupe magnification(X4), we found a neglected Plastibell remnant string. We removed it with an eye scissor and inserted a 6 French Foley catheter in his urethra for two weeks.
Patient: I see. What's the next step for my son?
Doctor: Your son will be referred to a tertiary urethral and penile reconstructive center for further treatment. Unfortunately, I have to inform you that the penile glans auto amputation occurred spontaneously after 45 days during his daily activities with minimal bleeding (Fig.).
Patient: Oh my! What can be done now?
Doctor: We've inserted the Foley catheter again for 2 weeks, and we're recommending a watchful waiting approach for three months. Currently, he is being managed conservatively with daily urethral self-dilation and is a candidate for future reconstructive surgery.
Patient: Thank you, doctor, for the information and guidance. We'll make sure to follow your recommendations and look forward to the reconstructive surgery.","Patient reports decreased urinary strength and caliber for approximately one month, which may indicate mild prostatitis. The patient states that their son experienced several lower urinary tract symptoms such as dysuria, but no other upper urinary tract symptoms, including intermittent hematuria and downward urination. They mention a slight decrease in urine output at times but no obvious urge to void. They describe a small area of necropsied tissue in the penis and discuss concerns about neglecting the foveal remnant."
24,"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me how you've been feeling lately?
Patient: Hi, I've had a headache for the past 6 months and I'm having trouble seeing on the right side of my vision.
Doctor: I see. I understand you've been struggling at school as well?
Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to keep up with my studies.
Doctor: Based on your MRI results, you have a suprasellar apoplectic tumor, and your prolactin level is quite high at 30,824 miU/L. We'll start you on a dopamine agonist and monitor you as an outpatient.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: We'll also regularly check your visual field and prolactin levels to track your progress. After a year, please come back for a follow-up.
Patient: Alright, I will.
*After a year*
Patient: Hi again, my vision seems to be getting worse.
Doctor: I see, let's take a look at your recent MRI. It shows that your apoplectic tumor has enlarged, despite your prolactin level now being at 63 miU/L. We will need to perform an Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery (ETSS) to prevent further visual loss.
Patient: I understand.
*After surgery*
Doctor: Your surgery was successful. Both your vision and academic performance should return to normal.
Patient: That's great to hear, thank you so much!
Doctor: You're welcome. The histology report confirmed that your tumor was a prolactinoma with apoplexy. The Ki67 and p53 labelling were not elevated, which is a good sign.
Patient: That's a relief. Thank you for all your help, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome! Just make sure to continue with your follow-up appointments and tests to monitor your progress. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact us.
Patient: Will do. Thanks again!","Patient reports experiencing headaches and difficulty seeing on the right side of their vision for six months. Doctors determine they are suffering from a suprasellar apoplectic tumor and schedule an ETSS procedure with positive surgical margins. Follow-ups show progressive vision loss but no increase in prolactin or other markers of disease activity. Patient consults with the doctor after one year and undergoes a follow-up examination with MRI showing worsening neurologic deficits consistent with endocrine involvement. Patient expresses concern about potential adverse effects such as optic nerve injury, cataract formation, or retinal detachment, and requests regular follow-up evaluations."
25,"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I'm here to report the case of a 91-year-old woman who developed a generalized maculopapular skin eruption after using icodextrin dialysate solutions for CAPD. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, doctor. I have stage IV congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, secondary to massive tricuspid valve failure and severe mitral valve deficiency. I also have chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate (eGFR) of 20 ml/min/1.73m2.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you had a Tenckhoff peritoneal catheter surgically inserted recently. Can you tell me about your experience during your prolonged hospitalization in the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit?
Patient: Yes, I was in the hospital for a while because there was leakage from the peritoneal catheter exit site. I was eventually discharged, and my CAPD regimen included 2 icodextrin exchanges per day.
Doctor: That's correct. The daily dose of icodextrin relative to your body weight was 41.7 ml/kg, and the peritoneal ultrafiltration volume was 600 ml/day. You were then re-evaluated 7 days later, and the CAPD regimen was intensified with the addition of another exchange during the day with dialysate glucose 1.36%. This resulted in a peritoneal ultrafiltration of approximately 800 ml/day.
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: On Day 15 after your initial exposure to icodextrin, you were admitted to the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit due to a widespread maculopapular and exfoliative skin rash extending over your abdomen, arms, legs, and back. Can you describe how the rash looked and felt?
Patient: It was a sudden skin rash that was red and bumpy, covering a large area of my body. It was very itchy and uncomfortable.
Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. During your admission, we conducted a physical examination. Your normal body temperature was 36.7 °C, blood pressure 105/60 mmHg, pulse rate 70 bpm, oxygen saturation 95% in the room air, and there was an absence of abnormal clinical signs from the chest auscultation and palpation of the abdomen.
Patient: Okay, so what's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust your CAPD regimen as needed to minimize the risk of further skin eruptions. It's important that you report any new symptoms or changes in your health to your healthcare team promptly.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to keep you updated on my condition.
[If the patient eventually dies, the conversation could continue with the patient's family:]
Doctor: I'm very sorry to inform you that your loved one has passed away. We did everything we could to treat her condition and manage her symptoms, but unfortunately, her health continued to decline. Please accept my deepest condolences.
Family: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate all the efforts you and your team made to care for her.",
26,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented to our hospital with the chief complaint of hematochezia and malaise. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've had fresh bloody stools twice. Once on the day of admission and another time 10 days earlier. I've been feeling really weak too.
Doctor: I understand. Have you had any previous surgeries or medical issues?
Patient: Yes, I had open surgery for an AAA 20 months ago.
Doctor: Alright, thank you for the information. We conducted a computed tomography (CT) scan and an abdominal examination. There was nothing remarkable and no tenderness. Your blood pressure is 122/75 mmHg, heart rate is 86/minute, body temperature is 36.6 °C, breathing rate is 16 per minute, and your hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We also performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and total colonoscopy to investigate the bleeding. They revealed colon diverticula but no source of the bleeding.
Patient: So, what's next?
Doctor: The contrast-enhanced CT scan showed gas within the aneurysm sac and adhesion between the graft and the intestinal tract in three areas. There was an adhesion between the ileum and the anastomosis of the left branch of the graft and left common iliac artery, the jejunum to the middle of the graft body, and the duodenum to the anastomosis between the aorta and the proximal graft.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Enterococcus faecium was isolated from your blood culture, which suggests communication between the intestinal tract and aorta at the attached sites, possibly due to an infection of the graft. Your vital signs are stable, so we will schedule surgery after treating you with antibiotics.
Patient: Alright, I hope that works.
Doctor: After admission, you produced another fresh bloody stool, but the bleeding ceased immediately. However, 18 days after the second fresh bloody stool, you suddenly went into a state of shock, experienced massive fresh bloody stool and hematemesis, and then went into cardiac arrest.
Patient: What happened next?
Doctor: Despite intensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, unfortunately, you passed away due to hemorrhagic shock. An autopsy was performed with consent from your family.
Patient's Family: What did the autopsy reveal?
Doctor: The autopsy revealed an ulcerative fistula in the distal ileum that adhered to the anastomosis between the left branch of the graft and the left common iliac artery. This was the cause of the severe bleeding and subsequent complications. Our deepest condolences to your family.","thoracostomy tube.
Patient: And then what happened?
Doctor: Our team decided to reimplant your graft using a new material made of polymethylmethacrylate pmcma. We used 55 gauge cannulas to insert the graft via the anterior portal vein, without damaging the celiac axis. Additionally, we installed a new intraperitoneal d"
27,"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your medical history, especially any issues related to thrombocytopenia?
Patient: Yeah, I've had thrombocytopenia since childhood. My mother, maternal aunt, brother, and son also have it. We don't know the genetic cause though. 
Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that information. We found elevated levels in your blood tests. Your total protein is 10.3 g/dl, serum monoclonal spike is 3.5 g/dl, immunoglobulin G (IgG) is 5371 mg/dl, and free lambda light chains are 703 mg/dl with a free kappa/lambda ratio of 0.08. 
Patient: Hmm, I see. What about my calcium and renal function?
Doctor: Your calcium and renal function are within normal limits, which is good. Your hemoglobin level is 16.6 g/dL, and your platelet count is 33 × 103/μL.
Patient: Oh, okay. Did the skeletal survey show anything?
Doctor: The skeletal survey was negative for any lytic lesions, which is great news. Your bone marrow examination showed adequate megakaryocytes with normal platelet morphology, and no dysmegakaryopoiesis or micromegakaryocytes were seen on the bone marrow. Erythrocytes and granulocytes were also adequate in number without any significant abnormality.
Patient: That's a relief. What about my past medical history?
Doctor: Your past medical history includes essential hypertension and hypogonadism, but no neuropathy or dermatologic conditions. 
Patient: Have there been any issues with my vision, hearing, or bleeding disorders?
Doctor: No, there's no personal or family history of physical deformity, vision, hearing, or bleeding disorders. Your platelet count history ranged from 30 to 50 × 103/μL.
Patient: What about my hemoglobin and hematocrit levels?
Doctor: Your repeat testing of hemoglobin was 17.9 g/dl with a hematocrit of 55.6%. The peripheral blood examination showed normal appearing red and white blood cells, with erythrocytosis, and morphologically normal platelets that were decreased in number.
Patient: Is my Erythropoietin level normal?
Doctor: Yes, your Erythropoietin level is normal at 12.2 mIU/mL. Molecular testing found no mutations in JAK2 V617F or BCR/ABL1 (p190 and p210).
Patient: So, why do I have erythrocytosis?
Doctor: The erythrocytosis is attributed to the use of testosterone supplementation for your hypogonadism.
Patient: I see. Did the congenital thrombocytopenia testing panel show anything?
Doctor: We ordered a limited congenital thrombocytopenia testing panel, and it came back negative for mutations in myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), and myosin heavy chain.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. What do I need to do for follow-up?
Doctor: You should continue to monitor your health and have regular check-ups. We will keep an eye on your blood levels and manage any complications if they arise. It's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and follow your treatment plan for hypertension and hypogonadism. If you experience any new symptoms or worsening of your condition, please reach out to us immediately.",
28,"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you are gravida 3, para 2, and have been referred to our institution due to a neck mass found on prenatal ultrasonography (US). Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Can you tell me more about the neck mass? When was it discovered?
Patient: It was found at 30.6 weeks. The sonogram showed a 10 by 8 cm mass on the right side of my baby's neck. It wasn't present in the scans taken at 14 and 22 weeks.
Doctor: I see. Our ultrasound studies also show that the mass is composed of a cystic portion and a solid portion containing blood vessels, and it's growing rapidly. Additionally, we've noticed a significant polyhydramnios with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 50. This suggests an upper gastrointestinal obstruction and a highly possible airway obstruction as well. Were these findings confirmed by fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?
Patient: Yes, they were.
Doctor: Considering the difficulty in establishing a secured airway at birth and the potential complicated resection of the giant tumor after birth, we've referred you to our hospital for consultation. Our maternal fetal team, neonatologist, anesthesiologist, pediatric surgeon, and otolaryngologist have been involved in your case. We understand that you were presented with a guarded prognosis but insisted on continuing the pregnancy with maximal efforts during delivery and the neonatal period. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, we want to do everything we can for our baby.
Doctor: In that case, we've planned an EXIT procedure, which provides the best chance to establish a patent airway for your baby. We've informed you about the risks for the mother, including significant hemorrhage from the uterus due to the uterine relaxation necessary to avoid placental separation, and a possible uterine resection in the case of a life-threatening hemorrhage. Are you aware of these risks?
Patient: Yes, we understand the risks and are willing to go forward with the procedure.
Doctor: Given the risk of an unplanned preterm delivery due to polyhydramnios and uterine contractions, we've scheduled you for a planned cesarean delivery at 34 weeks. We have organized and prepared a multidisciplinary team, including obstetricians, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, otolaryngologists, pediatric surgeons, pulmonologists, and cardiologists, to be ready to perform the EXIT procedure. Do you have any questions or concerns about this plan?
Patient: No, we trust your team and appreciate the efforts in helping our baby.
Doctor: Thank you for your trust. We'll do everything we can to ensure the best possible outcome for you and your baby. Please follow the instructions given to you by the team and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your care and support.","safely. The surgical field will then be closed by applying a 70 suture, while maintaining constant low tension through the endovascular technique. This ensures a stable sealing of the wound with minimal risk of reperfusion injury. We anticipate performing three"
29,"Doctor: Hello, can you remind me when you first presented to the hospital with your symptoms?
Patient: I first came in May 1998.
Doctor: Yes, I see you had spontaneous bruising and mucosal bleeding at that time. Do you remember what your platelet count was?
Patient: Hmm, I think it was really low, around 2 × 109/L.
Doctor: That's correct. We found no other abnormalities in your blood counts or laboratory tests. You also have a history of alopecia totalis, but no other concomitant illness and no family history of blood disorders, right?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: So, we treated you with prednisone 100 mg daily, which improved your platelet count. However, when the dose was gradually reduced and stopped, the thrombocytopenia returned. In December 1998, you underwent a laparoscopic splenectomy, which resulted in a positive platelet count response, lasting 4 years. Do you recall when your thrombocytopenia relapsed?
Patient: I think it was in April 2003.
Doctor: Yes, and after another course of prednisone, your platelet count displayed a cyclical pattern, alternating between thrombocytopenia and thrombocytosis. Your platelet count would fluctuate with a statistically significant period of 39 days, ranging from nadir values of less than 5 × 109/L to peak values of greater than 900 × 109/L. We also found statistically significant oscillations in your neutrophil counts with the same period, but the neutrophil nadir never dropped below the normal range. 
Patient: Yeah, I remember that.
Doctor: Cyclic thrombocytopenia persisted for over 10 years despite treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, danazol, pulse dexamethasone, and rituximab. We measured your TPO levels for a period of 6 weeks and found that they were undetectable during periods of extreme thrombocytosis and increased when platelet counts were low.
Patient: So, what's the next step in treatment?
Doctor: We started treatment with the oral TPO receptor agonist eltrombopag, timed with anticipated periods of thrombocytopenia. Specifically, treatment was withheld during anticipated periods of escalating platelet counts and restarted when your platelet count was anticipated to drop below 100 × 109/L. You received 50 mg of eltrombopag daily from 30 November to 6 December 2010 and 2 January.
Patient: Ok, got it. So, will I continue with this treatment?
Doctor: Yes, we will continue to monitor your platelet count and adjust the eltrombopag treatment as needed. It's important to keep in close contact with us so we can ensure the best possible management of your condition.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care.","enia, you were given intravenous aspirin as well as an antiplatelet agent called ticlopid"
30,"Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing epigastric pain since yesterday. It started about 15 minutes after I ate sushi.
Doctor: I see. Have you had any nausea, diarrhea, or other symptoms?
Patient: No, just the intermittent epigastric pain.
Doctor: Are you currently pregnant or have any ongoing health conditions?
Patient: Yes, I'm in early pregnancy, but there have been no abnormalities during the pregnancy so far.
Doctor: Alright. Let me examine you. *checks for epigastric tenderness, rebound tenderness, and guarding* You have mild epigastric tenderness, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. We'll need to run some tests, such as laboratory work, an electrocardiogram, and abdominal ultrasonography to better understand your condition. Due to your pregnancy, we won't be doing radiography or computed tomography.
Patient: Okay, that sounds fine.
*After tests*
Doctor: Your test results came back normal. Given your symptoms and the fact that you ate sushi prior to developing the pain, we suspect anisakiasis. We'll need to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to confirm and potentially remove the foreign material.
Patient: Alright, let's do it.
*After esophagogastroduodenoscopy*
Doctor: During the procedure, we found a linear foreign material stuck in the lesser curvature of the antrum. We carefully removed it with alligator forceps. There were no signs of bleeding or perforation, but we clipped the wound to be certain. We determined the foreign body to be a broken wooden toothpick, approximately 4 cm in length.
Patient: Oh, wow! I'm glad it's out.
Doctor: We recommend you be admitted to our hospital for observation. However, if you prefer not to, we can carefully conduct outpatient follow-up.
Patient: I'd prefer not to be admitted, as long as it's safe.
Doctor: Understood. We'll instruct you to fast for 1 day and then start a fluid diet from the second day onwards. Please return to our hospital in three days for a follow-up.
*Three days later*
Patient: I'm back for my follow-up appointment. I have no symptoms now.
Doctor: That's great to hear! Since you're feeling better and have no symptoms, you may now return to eating regular meals. Be cautious about foreign objects in your food to prevent a similar incident in the future.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor! I'll be more careful from now on.",
31,"Doctor: Hello! I see that you were referred to our hospital for a lung adenocarcinoma measuring 28 mm in your right upper lobe. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: We have planned a UVATS procedure to resect the tumor. Are you familiar with this procedure?
Patient: Not really, can you explain it to me?
Doctor: Of course. During the procedure, you will be placed in the left lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia. We will then make a 4-cm skin incision for the main port in the sixth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line.
Patient: Okay, I see.
Doctor: A wound retractor will be used to allow the insertion of a flexible thoracoscope, endoscopic autosuturing device, and vessel-sealing device via the main port incision. This will also allow us to extract the specimen after the operation.
Patient: Hmm, I understand.
Doctor: During the operation, we found an incomplete interlobar fissure between the upper and middle lobe, as well as abnormal lobulation of the upper lobe. Therefore, we carried out a modified marionette technique.
Patient: What does that involve?
Doctor: First, an Internal organ retractor was inserted into the thoracic cavity using a clip applier. This allowed the retractor to grasp the targeted lung parenchyma properly.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Second, we prepared two sets of looped 1-0 nylon-threaded 18-gauge injection needles. These needles were optimally pierced through the thoracic wall separately.
Patient: And then what happened?
Doctor: Finally, both ends of the 1-0 nylon thread attached to the Internal organ retractor were pulled out through the looped nylon. This allowed us to perform the procedure more effectively.
Patient: I see. So, what are the follow-up requirements for this procedure?
Doctor: You will need regular check-ups and monitoring to ensure that the tumor has been completely removed and that there are no complications. We will provide you with more information regarding your follow-up appointments.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the explanation.
Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. We're here to help.

Patient: Hi, Doctor. Lately, I've been feeling progressively more short of breath and weak.
Doctor: I see. I have your records here, and it looks like you initially presented to an outside hospital with these symptoms. They found that your anemia had worsened compared to your baseline. Chest imaging also demonstrated a large left pleural effusion, for which you underwent thoracentesis. You were then transferred to our institution for further management.
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: On presentation to our institution, your blood pressure was 131/85 mmHg, pulse 90 beats/min, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. Your temperature was 98.1F and your oxygen saturation was 98% while breathing supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula at 2 L/min. You seemed to be in mild respiratory distress. Can you describe how you were feeling then?
Patient: I was having trouble breathing, and I felt really weak and tired.
Doctor: Okay, thank you. During your examination, we noticed a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur in your cardiac exam. Your lung examination showed decreased breath sounds at the left base with dullness to percussion. Other findings included pallor, palpable splenomegaly, and lower extremity edema. 
Patient: Yeah, I noticed the swelling in my legs too.
Doctor: Your laboratory evaluation showed some abnormal values. You had leukocytosis, with a count of 18.4 k/mm3, which is above the normal range of 4.8-10.8 k/mm3, and an increase in myeloid precursors. Your hemoglobin was 5.6 g/dl, which is lower than the normal range of 12-16 g/dL. You also had thrombocytopenia with a count of 77 k/mm3, below the normal range of 160-410 k/mm3. Your lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 882 U/L, higher than the normal range of 125-220 U/L. However, your coagulation parameters were unremarkable.
Patient: That's a lot of numbers, but it sounds like things aren't looking too good.
Doctor: Yes, it's important for us to monitor these values closely. Your chest X-ray showed complete opacification of the left hemithorax with rightward displacement of the trachea. We urgently placed a left chest tube which yielded grossly bloody pleural fluid consisting of a red blood cell (RBC) count of 1,415,000/mm3 and an LDH of 1555 U/L. We will continue to manage your condition and make adjustments to your treatment as needed.
Patient: I appreciate your help, Doctor. What should I expect going forward?
Doctor: We will closely monitor your symptoms and laboratory values. It's crucial to keep an open line of communication with us about any changes in your symptoms. We'll do our best to manage your myelofibrosis and complications, such as pancytopenia and massive splenomegaly, while keeping you as comfortable as possible.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to keep you updated on how I'm feeling.

Patient: Hi, I've been having this intermittent pain on my right lower abdomen for about 36 hours now. I also lost my appetite, vomited a few times, and have a high-grade fever.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any pathological personal or family medical history that we should be aware of?
Patient: No, not really.
Doctor: Alright, let's examine your abdomen. *Examines right iliac fossa* It appears tender to palpation, but I don't see any peritoneal signs. We'll need to run some tests.
*After tests*
Doctor: Your initial laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and an elevated C-reactive protein. We also performed an ultrasonography of your abdomen, which revealed a 40x37mm heterogeneous lesion within the colon, no appendix, and some swollen mesenteric nodes of at least 10mm.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We needed more information, so we did an abdominal CT scan. The findings were suggestive of ileocolic intussusception with an invagination area of about 6.6x4.9cm.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It's a condition where part of the intestine slides into an adjacent part. After a surgical consult, you underwent an exploratory laparoscopy, which required laparotomy conversion. We found a well-defined, 5cm mass at the ileo cecal valve and multiple hard pericecal lymph nodes. 
Patient: What happened next?
Doctor: During the surgery, we observed preserved permeability between the ileum and colon, complete integrity of the cecum wall, and a lack of vermiform appendix. The possibility of an auto-digested appendix and a cecal tumor were discussed. The surgeons decided to resect the retrocecal and pericecal lymph nodes and send the samples to pathology before any further intervention.
Patient: So, what's the plan now?
Doctor: You were admitted to the inpatient floor, and we started antibiotic therapy based on ampicillin sulbactam and metronidazole. We consulted the oncology department, and they ordered some complementary laboratory exams, including liver and renal function tests, uric acid, electrolytes, lactic dehydrogenase, and quantiferon-TB tests. Only your lactic dehydrogenase was altered.
Patient: Is there anything else I should know?
Doctor: We also did a chest x-ray to rule out any mediastinal masses, and there were no alarming findings. However, on your second day of hospitalization, you presented with gastric distension, abdominal pain, and fever. The content inside your suprapubic JP drain changed from a serohematic aspect to a dense cloudy fluid.
Patient: What will you do about that?
Doctor: We collected a culture and performed a cytochemical analysis of the peritoneal fluid to better understand what's going on. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. Rest assured, we will do our best to help you recover.",
34,"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith from the Institutional Review Board. Your wife has been admitted to our Department of Acute Critical Care Medicine. She was found unconscious by you after ingesting an unknown amount of boric acid, mirtazapine, and sennosides. Is that correct?
Husband: Yes, that's correct. She has a history of depression, and I found her in that state.
Doctor: Upon her arrival, her vital signs were quite concerning. Her blood pressure was 45/13 mmHg, heart rate at 190 beats per minute, and a body temperature of 37.0 °C. We also noticed she had systemic diffuse erythema. Did you notice any other symptoms before she was transported here?
Husband: No, there were no other physical findings that I noticed.
Doctor: We performed an Electrocardiography (ECG) which showed atrial fibrillation tachycardia. To stabilize her, we had to perform tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. A cardiac echocardiogram depicted diffuse hypokinesis of wall motion with an ejection fraction of 20%. Chest roentgenography revealed no significant findings.
Husband: What about her brain condition?
Doctor: We performed a whole-body computed tomography to evaluate her brain condition, residual drugs in her stomach, and any accompanying lesions. The scan indicated bilateral dorsal lung consolidation, which suggests aspiration. We also conducted an arterial blood gas analysis, cell blood count, and a biochemical study.
Husband: What happened next?
Doctor: Unfortunately, she exhibited pulseless electrical activity. We managed to obtain spontaneous circulation through advanced life support, but she experienced repeated episodes of pulseless electrical activity. Due to her unstable circulation, we had to perform percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass.
Husband: Was there any issue with her heart?
Doctor: We conducted an emergency coronary angiogram which came out negative. She was then admitted to the intensive care unit. Due to acute kidney injury with anuria, we initiated continuous hemodialysis filtration.
Husband: How is she now?
Doctor: Currently, she remains in a deep coma state without sedation. On the second hospital day, her cardiac motion ceased on the echocardiogram, but her atrial fibrillation rhythm continued.
Husband: What are the next steps for her treatment?
Doctor: As you strongly wish to continue the treatments, we will do so until cardiac standstill. We'll continue monitoring her condition closely and keep you informed of any changes.","istress?
Doctor: They used continuous positive airway pressure, high frequency oscillations, and manual ventilation in combination with bilevel positive airway pressure, endotracheal intubation, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. The use of these devices helped improve her respiratory function.

Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: During our initial workup, we found that you had a positive QuantiFERON-TB test, but your sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture were negative. We discharged you to follow-up in our pulmonary clinic. Can you tell me if you've had any new symptoms since then?
Patient: Well, I've started having new-onset headaches and seizures recently.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. During your physical examination, we noticed bitemporal visual deficits. We performed a brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed numerous infratentorial and supratentorial ring-enhancing brain lesions with vasogenic edema. Our differentials at this point were neurocysticercosis, tuberculomas, toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, and metastatic brain cancer. 
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: To further investigate, we decided to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule in what we believed to be an infectious etiology. The LP showed an opening pressure of 370 mm H2O, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count of 8 × 103/µL, and CSF glucose and protein were 50 mg/dL and 89 mm/dL, respectively, with a 55% lymphocyte predominance.
Patient: Okay, what does that mean?
Doctor: These results point towards an infectious cause. We also screened you for HIV with an Ab/Ag (antibody/antigen) screen, which was nonreactive. Based on our high suspicion for TB, we've empirically placed you on 4 anti-TB medications and a steroid. 
Patient: I see.
Doctor: We also performed a pleural biopsy, which confirmed TB as the cause of your symptoms. We will continue with the anti-TB medications and steroid treatment. It's important that you follow up with us regularly to monitor your progress.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to follow up.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you experience any new symptoms or worsening of your current symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to help you.",
36,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having intermittent, crampy right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past 18 hours. It's really bothering me.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history and any previous surgeries you've had?
Patient: Yes, I have hypertension. I also had a thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer and a Caesarean section in the past.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Given your symptoms, I'd like to perform a contrast-enhanced CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better understanding of your condition. Is that okay with you?
Patient: Sure, let's do it.
(After the CT scan)
Doctor: The CT scan shows multiple fluid-filled, dilated small bowel loops in your right abdomen. We've identified two transition points in the right lower quadrant, one at the distal ileum and another in the proximal ileum. These findings are indicative of a closed loop obstruction. There's also decreased wall enhancement of the dilated small bowel loops, which is concerning for ischemia.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?
Doctor: Ischemia means that there's a lack of blood supply to that area, which can be dangerous. Given your symptoms and the findings on the CT scan, we need to take you to the operating room for further examination and treatment.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
(In the operating room)
Doctor: We've confirmed that you have an internal hernia with closed loop obstruction. It appears to have been caused by an adhesion of a transverse colon epiploic appendage to the ascending colon mesentery. Unfortunately, the herniated small bowel is nonviable, so we had to resect, or remove, a total of 60 cm of your small bowel.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What happens next?
Doctor: After the resection, we've left your small bowel in discontinuity and placed an abdominal wound-vac. You'll need to return to the operating room tomorrow for further assessment.
(The following day)
Doctor: We found that the terminal ileum was also nonviable, so we performed an ileocecectomy with enterocolonic anastomosis to repair the damage.
Patient: Will I recover from this?
Doctor: Your postoperative course may be complicated, but with proper care, you should recover. You'll be discharged approximately two weeks after the initial surgery. We'll monitor your progress closely and provide you with the necessary care during your recovery.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","e severe abdominal pain, we needed to refer you to our specialized care center immediately. We expect you to make a full recovery.
Patient: Aww, thank you for helping me."
37,"Doctor: Hi, I understand you've been experiencing bladder outlet obstruction and bladder stones. Can you tell me more about your medical history?
Patient: Sure, I have a history of BPH, which caused recurrent urinary tract infections. I also had elevated prostate-specific antigen levels, but the biopsy came back negative. Additionally, I have hyperlipidemia and hypertension.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed a preoperative transrectal ultrasound, which estimated your prostate volume to be 150 cc. We decided to do a HoLEP surgery using a two-incision technique to help with your bladder issues.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: During the surgery, we encountered a large amount of adenoma, so we spent an extended time on morcellation, about 120 minutes. However, there was poor observation due to bleeding at the bladder neck, and we noted an area of capsular perforation at the 5 o'clock position in the mid gland.
Patient: Oh, I see. What happened next?
Doctor: When we removed the operative drapes, we noticed significant abdominal distention. In a discussion with the anesthetist, your airway pressures upon induction were initially between 10 and 20, but during the procedure, they increased to over 30. Your systolic pressure also dropped to 80-90, whereas preoperatively you were above 110 systolic.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We were concerned about a potential bladder injury and consulted general surgery intraoperatively. They recommended a subumbilical minilaparotomy, as initial laparoscopy was unsuccessful due to increased opening pressures with the Veress needle.
Patient: What happened during the minilaparotomy?
Doctor: We suctioned less than 400 cc of bloody-colored fluid from your abdomen. An intraoperative cystogram was performed, which revealed retroperitoneal extravasation but no intraperitoneal bladder injury or perforation.
Patient: So, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that the capsular perforation likely caused extraperitonealization of intraoperative saline. We placed a 10F Jackson Pratt drain in your pelvis and closed the fascia and skin. We also administered 20 mg of IV Lasix during the procedure.
Patient: What are the next steps for me?
Doctor: We will monitor your recovery closely and ensure that the drain is functioning properly. It is crucial that you follow up with us so that we can assess your progress and address any concerns you may have.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and get well soon.","OAP
Surgical Procedure
The patient was then brought into the operating room (om) and introduced via a side port before being placed supine in the prone position. The first incision through the right flank was made on the outer border of the navel, followed by a second incision 2 cm laterally toward the pubis and urethral mucosa. This allowed for direct access to the rectus sheaths. A pneumatic cannula was inserted to"
38,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing episodes of atrial tachycardia and I'm quite worried about it.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I'm a 39-year-old female and I have a univentricular heart condition called tricuspid atresia. I've had two cardiac surgeries in the past, the last one being an atrio-pulmonary Fontan surgery 33 years ago.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Due to your serious right atriomegaly and frequent episodes of atrial tachycardia, you might be a candidate for Fontan conversion surgery. Before the surgery, it's important to note that your pre-operative ventricular function is mildly reduced at 50%.
Patient: Okay, what can I expect after the surgery?
Doctor: In some cases, patients may experience severe single ventricle dysfunction post-operatively, which can result in low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) and the need for ECMO implantation.
Patient: That sounds serious. What if I can't be weaned off the ECMO?
Doctor: Unfortunately, in some cases where patients cannot be weaned from ECMO due to multi-organ failure, they may not survive. However, many patients do successfully recover from the surgery.
Patient: I understand. What about other complications after the surgery?
Doctor: Some patients may require pacemaker implantation due to post-operative sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. All patients are discharged on oral antiarrhythmic medication for 3-6 months and anticoagulants for 6 months. At discharge, most patients are in sinus rhythm, some have a stable pacemaker rhythm, and a few have atrial fibrillation or flutter.
Patient: If I need a pacemaker, when would that happen?
Doctor: In some cases, a patient may need a pacemaker implant a few months after the operation due to the presence of sinus node dysfunction.
Patient: How can I expect to feel after the surgery?
Doctor: During a median follow-up of 14 months, many patients show an improvement in their NYHA functional class. Some patients in NYHA class III progress to class II or even class I, while others in class II progress to class I.
Patient: What about the recurrence of arrhythmia?
Doctor: Recurrence of arrhythmia occurs in about 8.6% of patients more than 3 months after surgery. These patients usually have a history of atrial fibrillation and are treated with right-sided Maze rather than Cox maze III due to technical issues.
Patient: And what about my electrocardiogram at follow-up?
Doctor: At follow-up, most patients are in sinus rhythm, some have stable pacemaker rhythm, and a few have permanent atrial fibrillation.
Patient: What about anti-arrhythmic therapy?
Doctor: At a median follow-up of 14 months, about 69% of patients are in stable sinus rhythm, with 12 of them not requiring any anti-arrhythmic therapy.
Patient: Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to help you through this process.",
39,"Doctor: Hello, sir. I understand you've been experiencing multiple melenic bowel movements. Have you also been feeling lethargic and easily fatigued?
Patient: Yes, doctor. I've been feeling really tired and weak lately.
Doctor: I see. I also noticed in your history that you have been treated for symptomatic anaemia for the past two years. During the clinical examination, you appeared pale, tachycardic, but normotensive. Your abdominal examination was unremarkable, but the digital rectal examination revealed melena. We found that your haemoglobin has dropped from 11 g/dl to 4 g/dl.
Patient: Oh, that's quite a drop.
Doctor: Yes, it is. We promptly resuscitated you with blood products and performed an early upper endoscopy. The oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS) showed a small Forrest 3 antral ulcer with multiple subcentimeter gastric polyps. We biopsied the gastric polyps, and the histopathology revealed them to be benign.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: We also performed a colonoscopy, which showed blood-stained colonic mucosa, but no bleeding source was identified. An urgent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen revealed no significant abnormality and no bowel-related masses.
Patient: So, what's causing the bleeding then?
Doctor: After the acute gastrointestinal bleeding episode subsided, we worked on a presumptive diagnosis of a possible small intestinal bleed. We performed a capsule endoscopy, which showed several small telangiectasias in the proximal part of the small bowel. There was no visible tumour, polyps, or ulcers.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We then performed a double-balloon enteroscopy, which showed abnormal vascularity with a central umbilication over the mucosa of the small bowel. The mucosal abnormality was located at 165 cm from the incisor.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there is an issue with the blood vessels in your small bowel. We assessed your overall health with an ASA score of 1 and a Revised Cardiac Risk Index score of 1, which indicated that you were in good condition for surgery.
Patient: So, what's next?
Doctor: We performed a laparoscopic examination using a closed technique with a Veress needle. Intraoperative findings revealed an exophytic lesion measuring 6 cm. We will discuss the best course of action to address this lesion and manage your condition.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your thorough explanation and care.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to monitor your progress and keep you informed of any further findings or necessary treatments.","re excellent. No complication occurred, and there was no need for further intervention. You are now recovering well, thankfully. However, please continue taking your medications as directed by our physician.

40,"Doctor: Hi there, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been experiencing knee pain that seems to increase at night.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any similar issues in the past?
Patient: Yes, I had an OBL of the posterior spinal column treated 5 years ago.
Doctor: I see. That OBL was diagnosed through a CT scan and an MRI, right?
Patient: Yes, they demonstrated an osteolytic lesion of the second lumbar vertebrae.
Doctor: I remember reviewing the histological slides and confirming the OBL diagnosis. Now, let's focus on your current knee pain. Is it similar to the pain you experienced with the OBL?
Patient: Yes, it feels identical. The pain is almost constant and gets worse at night.
Doctor: Does it get relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs?
Patient: Yes, taking those does help.
Doctor: Are there any limitations in your knee movement or any neurovascular deficit?
Patient: No, I can move my knee just fine and don't have any other issues.
Doctor: Good to know. We performed a CT scan and an MRI to get a better understanding of your knee pain. The CT scan showed a small nidus without sclerosis, and the MRI confirmed the nidus with inflammation of the surrounding tissue.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also performed a bone scintigraphy to rule out more lesions. It showed increased activity in your left distal femur.
Patient: What does that mean for my treatment?
Doctor: Before starting radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment, we obtained a biopsy sample using the Bonopty set. With you under spinal anesthesia, a core-needle biopsy was performed under CT guidance.
Patient: Okay, and what happened next?
Doctor: We placed the needle electrode inside the nidus and performed RFA through the same tract with a 5-mm radiofrequency probe heated to 90 °C for 5 minutes, using the radiofrequency generator.
Patient: So, what's the diagnosis?
Doctor: The diagnosis is an OBL. We'll continue to monitor your progress and determine if any further treatment is necessary.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.","nd that the nidus had shrunk significantly, as evidenced by a decreased thickness of the tumor wall.
Patient: So, has the nidus grown back?
Doctor: Based on our clinical evaluation, we believe that the original tumor is still present but not growing anymore.

41,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, my 12-year-old daughter has been having some health issues. She recently had a seizure and lost consciousness.
Doctor: I see. How is she doing now?
Patient: She's better now. They gave her glucose at the hospital and she regained consciousness. She didn't have any significant comorbidities before this.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We'll need to look into her medical history and perform some tests to determine the cause of the seizure. 
Patient: Alright. So, what did you find out?
Doctor: After reviewing her history and conducting further tests, we diagnosed her with insulinoma and hyperparathyroidism in MEN-1. A computed tomography scan showed a vascularity-rich tumor, 20 mm in diameter, located in the head of her pancreas.
Patient: Oh no. What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there's a tumor in her pancreas which might be causing her symptoms. We also checked the feeding artery of the tumor but it wasn't clearly demonstrated through angiography and selective arterial calcium injection.
Patient: What are the next steps?
Doctor: We are considering extended surgical procedures like pancreatoduodenectomy, depending on the intraoperative findings. We will be performing open abdominal surgery rather than laparoscopic surgery to address this issue.
Patient: What about her parathyroid hormone levels?
Doctor: Her intact parathyroid hormone level is 66.0 pg/ml, which is slightly elevated, and her adjusted serum calcium level is 10.3 mg/dL. However, the parathyroid ultrasound examination didn't reveal any parathyroid tumor.
Patient: Are there any other tumors?
Doctor: We didn't detect any other tumors associated with MEN-1 in her case. The results of other preoperative examinations were unremarkable.
Patient: What about her blood glucose management during surgery?
Doctor: We inserted an Enlite™ sensor of MiniMed™ 620G Diabetes SCGM system into her upper arm the day before surgery. Although it's combined with an insulin pump, we didn't use the pump. The system was calibrated using a OneTouch® UltraVue™ Blood Glucose Meter from Johnson & Johnson.
Patient: Okay, and what about premedication?
Doctor: No premedication was given, and she walked into the operating room. Her capillary BG was 80 mg/dL and the SCGM system was calibrated. We started continuous glucose infusion during the procedure.
Patient: Thank you for explaining everything. We appreciate your help and guidance during this difficult time.","now or worry about?
Doctor: No, there isn't anything else we need to discuss. You may return for follow up appointments if necessary.
Patient: Thank you so much for your explanation, Doctor. I appreciate your professional care. S O: Patient reports experiencing a seizure and losing consciousness. Doctors conducted investigations and discovered insulinomas and hyperparathyroidism in MEN-1.

42,"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of progressive lower limbs weakness and difficulty in climbing stairs and posture changes. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been having this weakness for about two years now. I also sometimes have difficulty swallowing.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms or changes in your health?
Patient: Not really, it has mostly been the limb weakness and occasional difficulty in swallowing.
Doctor: Okay. Let's discuss your family history. Are there any cases of diabetes, cardiac conduction disorders, or ischaemic heart disease in your family?
Patient: My mother had diabetes and cardiac conduction disorders. She passed away at 85. My father had ischaemic heart disease and died at 90.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important to consider your personal and family history when evaluating your condition. Now let me go through the results of your neurological examination. We found mild proximal weakness in your lower and upper limbs, as well as mild neck flexor muscles weakness (MRC 4/5).
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: We also performed a forearm ischaemic test and found basal hyperlactacidemia (42 mg/dL, reference value 4.5-19.8 mg/dL). This indicates an increased level of lactic acid in your blood.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: Your electromyography showed a myopathic pattern, which is consistent with muscle disease. Furthermore, your muscular CT revealed mild left femoral quadriceps and paravertebral muscles hypotrophy.
Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also conducted a cardiological evaluation and spirometry test, both of which were normal.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: Yes, it's good news. Now, your muscle biopsy results showed myopathic changes with scattered ragged red and blue fibers, as well as COX negative fibers.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: These findings, along with an ultrastructural examination, confirmed the presence of mitochondrial alterations in your muscle tissue, including mitochondrial hyperplasia, ring cristae, intramitochondrial lipid inclusion, and mitochondria with transversal orientation to the myofiber.
Patient: Wow, that's a lot of information.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Lastly, we performed a muscular mtDNA sequencing and discovered heteroplasmic mutations m.5835G>A in the MT-TY gene, which codes for tRNA Tyrosine. This mutation was found to be heteroplasmic in your skeletal muscle.
Patient: So, what does all this mean for me?
Doctor: These findings suggest that you have a mitochondrial myopathy, which is a type of muscle disease caused by genetic mutations affecting the mitochondria in your muscle cells. This can explain your symptoms of limb weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, and changes in posture.
Patient: What can I do to manage this condition?
Doctor: It's important to work closely with your healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan. This may include physical therapy, medications, and regular follow-up appointments to monitor your condition.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your thorough explanation and guidance.",
43,"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I understand you were admitted to the Department of Neurology here at the IRCCS Policlinico San Donato. Can you tell me about your symptoms?
Patient: Hi, doctor. Yeah, I've been having muscular stiffness and grip myotonia since I was 12. I've also had difficulties in fine finger movements and diffuse muscle stiffness, especially when I wake up in the morning.
Doctor: I see. Have these symptoms changed over time?
Patient: Yes, they've worsened over time and with cold, but they improve with repetitive movement.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We conducted a neurological examination to assess your muscle strength and tone. The results showed normal muscle strength (grade 5 MRC in all muscles tested) and tone. We also noticed a lid lag, eyelid and mild tongue myotonia. Severe grip myotonia was evident, with a positive warm-up phenomenon. Your deep tendon reflexes were normal.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We also performed an EMG, which showed diffuse signs of myotonic discharges in all muscles tested. Your EKG, Holter electrocardiographic recordings, and echocardiogram were all normal.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Now, we also conducted laboratory studies to check your electrolyte, urea, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. All of these were normal. However, your CPK was 231 U/L (normal values < 190 U/L), and your AST (56 U/L; normal values < 41 U/L) and GGT (106 U/L; normal values 8–61 U/L) were mildly increased.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Your lipid profile showed high levels of total cholesterol (260 mg/dl; normal values < 200 mg/dl), LDL cholesterol (174 mg/dl; normal values < 159 mg/dl), and triglycerides (356 mg/dl; normal values < 200 mg/dl). We also found evidence of hepatic steatosis through an abdomen ultrasound.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: Hepatic steatosis is a condition where there is an accumulation of fat in the liver. It can be caused by multiple factors, including high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, like in your case. It's important to address this issue to prevent further complications.
Patient: What should I do now, doctor?
Doctor: We'll need to monitor your condition closely and develop a treatment plan to manage your symptoms and address your high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. This may include lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and possibly medication.

Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: We performed a percutaneous coronary intervention to address this issue. Our expert operator guided the attending physician, who has 3 years of interventional experience. We conducted a coronary angiography through your right radial artery, which showed a 70% occlusion in the proximal segment of your left main anterior coronary artery (LM) and a 90% occlusion in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). 
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: We initially used a diagnostic catheter (6F TIG, TERUMO, Japan) which was withdrawn, and then advanced a hydrophilic guidewire (Merit Laureate; Merit Medical, USA). Unnoticed, it strayed into the distal right IMA. When the guiding catheter (6F EBU3.5, Medtronic, USA) was advanced over the guidewire, you complained of intolerable chest pain. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I remember the chest pain.
Doctor: We immediately withdrew the guiding catheter and guidewire, then reintroduced the guidewire into the aortic sinus. We delivered the guiding catheter to the left coronary artery and performed balloon dilatation and stenting of the LM and LAD. During that time, you again complained of severe chest pain, and your blood pressure began to fall. 
Patient: Yeah, it was really painful.
Doctor: Your condition deteriorated despite the administration of opioid analgesics and intravenous fluids. We performed a transthoracic echocardiography to rule out cardiac tamponade and aortic dissection, which it did. 
Patient: What did you find then?
Doctor: Fluoroscopy suggested a right-sided pleural haemothorax (Fig. c). We conducted an IMA angiography that revealed obvious exudation of contrast in the third rib segment of the right IMA. To address this issue, we introduced a 2.0 mm × 15 mm semi-compliant balloon (MINI TREK, Abbott, IL, USA) up to the site of the leak and kept it inflated for 20 minutes to reduce the exudation.
Patient: Did it help?
Doctor: Yes, bleeding was finally staunched by embolization with coils (Fig). It's important for you to continue monitoring your symptoms and follow up with us as needed. We'll keep a close eye on your condition and work together to manage your CAD risk factors.

45,"Doctor: Hello, we're here to evaluate your two-month-old daughter for seizures and hypotonia. She was presented at the Pediatric Department of Imam Reza Hospital in October 2016. I understand you have had a sibling who died at the age of 7 months with similar symptoms, and no specific metabolic assessment was conducted.
Mother: Yes, that's correct. We are really worried about our daughter.
Doctor: I see that your pregnancy had induced hypertension. Your daughter was a full-term baby, with a birth weight of 2500 grams, a length of 45 cm, and a head circumference of 32 cm. Her APGAR score was normal. She was admitted to the hospital on the fifth day of life with a chief complaint of neonatal jaundice. Is that correct?
Mother: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: At 2 months old, she had a history of fever, poor feeding, and vomiting for 2 days after routine vaccination. Her condition deteriorated with tonic-clonic seizures, difficulties in breathing, severe restlessness, lethargy, hypotonia, and she was in a coma for 1 day during her admission in the intensive care unit. Is that accurate?
Mother: Yes, that's what happened.
Doctor: After that admission, she had four more episodes with similar signs and symptoms, and between these crises, she was asymptomatic. Developmentally, at 8 months, she could not babble, had head drop, and could not sit with support. Is that correct?
Mother: Yes, she hasn't been able to sit or babble.
Doctor: During the physical examination, we found no organomegaly or hearing or visual abnormalities. The neurological examination showed hypotonia and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Is there anything else you want to share about her symptoms?
Mother: No, that covers everything we've noticed.
Doctor: We conducted an Arterial Blood Gas test, which revealed metabolic acidosis with a PH of 7.2, HCO3 of 5 mmol/L, base excess of -20, and pCO2 of 12.5 mmHg during her first acute attack. Also, we detected a high level of blood sugar and ketonuria. Her plasma showed normal Ammoniae (72 µmol/L) and lactate (11 mg/dl). We also found negative urine and blood culture, normal serum electrolytes, liver and renal, and thyroid function tests. The CSF analysis showed negative results for infection. Are you following me so far?
Mother: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: We also performed a Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which showed unspecific low signal intensity basal. Based on these findings, we will continue to monitor her condition and develop a treatment plan to help manage her symptoms. It's essential to keep an eye on her development and report any changes or new symptoms. Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: Yeah, I don't do well in school, and I used to have trouble walking, but it's better now.
Doctor: I see. We've conducted an MRI to look into these issues, and it showed a hyperintense signal, particularly in the right semi-oval center. This has been consistent in all the successive MRI studies we've done. Although your gait impairment has improved, there is still a certain degree of motor clumsiness.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: As for your learning problems, they seem to have worsened, and now you need a curricular adaptation. The school reports suggest that you may have borderline intelligence or mild mental retardation.
Patient: Oh, that's not good.
Doctor: We've also found some abnormalities in the transcription of your EN2 gene, which implies the deletion of 182 bases, specifically between 1944 and 2125 of the complementary sequence, marked as C5. This may be related to your developmental issues.
Patient: So, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there is a genetic factor contributing to your developmental delay and learning difficulties. However, we didn't find any alterations in genes LIS1, PTAFR, PAFAH1B2, PAFAH1B3, FGF8, and PAX2, which is a positive sign.
Patient: What can we do about it?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your progress and work closely with your school to provide you with the necessary support and adaptations to your curriculum. This will help you improve your learning experience and overall development.

Patient: Yeah, I've noticed occasional ankle swelling over the past year, but I've felt pretty good otherwise.
Doctor: I understand. Your past medical history shows that you were treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus in 2007, and you had a significant weight loss of 15 kg. It's great to see your glycosylated haemoglobin has been below 6% since 2013. Have you had any symptoms of macrovascular or microvascular complications?
Patient: No, I haven't noticed any symptoms like that.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I also see that you were diagnosed with hypertension more than 10 years ago, and you have a history of obesity with a body mass index of 47.6 g/m2. You also have degenerative spine disease. Your current medications are irbesartan 300 mg once daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, tramadol 50 mg three times a day, and meloxicam 7.5 mg as needed. There's also a family history of type 1 diabetes mellitus in your father and paternal uncle, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Upon examination, your blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg, and your heart sounds were dual with no murmurs. There was bipedal oedema up to the bottom third of your shins, but your jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and your chest was clear to auscultation. Initial laboratory investigation demonstrated haemoglobin at 149 g/L, white cell count at 7.20 × 109/L, platelets at 235 × 109/L, blood urea nitrogen at 6.0 mmol/L, serum creatinine at 70 μmol/L, and serum albumin at 32 g/L. Your serum electrolytes, liver enzymes, calcium, and phosphate levels are within the normal range.
Patient: Okay, that's good to know.
Doctor: Repeated urinalysis did not demonstrate any haematuria, leukocyturia, or casts. Your urine protein creatinine ratio was 662 mg/mmol, which is abnormal compared to your normal result in August 2012. We also checked your serum levels of antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, immunoglobulin A, cryoglobulins, complement factor C3, and C4, which were all normal. Human immunodeficiency virus screen, Hepatitis B antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies were negative.
Patient: So what does all that mean?
Doctor: Your results indicate that you have nephrotic range proteinuria, which means there is an abnormal amount of protein in your urine. This could be related to your history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We will continue to monitor your kidney function and adjust your medications if necessary. It's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and manage your blood pressure and blood sugar levels to prevent further complications.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything, doctor. I will make sure to follow your advice.",
48,"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 72-year-old Chinese female and a non-smoker. You've suffered from hypertension for over 30 years, chronic bronchitis for over 20 years, and diabetes for 6 years. What brings you here today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I was admitted to the hospital because I had a productive cough for three weeks, and then my symptoms became more severe during the past week.
Doctor: I see. During our examination, we found that your respiratory sounds were weak and coarser in the right lung field. Your laboratory examination revealed a high percentage of monocytes, a low level of hemoglobinn, and a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. We also performed an F-FDG PET-CTA, which showed a hypermetabolic mass in the upper lobe of your right lung and enlargement of your right hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes. These findings suggest that you may have lung cancer and lymph node metastases. The tumor measured 2.8 × 2.2 × 3 cm and appeared ulcerated.
Patient: Oh my. That's quite concerning.
Doctor: Yes, we needed to further investigate the tumor. We performed routine histologic sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, which showed that the tumor cells grew infiltratively in fibrous interstitium and arranged in sheets and syncytial pattern with marked pleomorphism. The neoplastic cells presented a vacuolar nucleus with prominent nucleoli and a marked lymphocytes infiltration.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: These findings are similar to those seen in nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma, so we first wanted to confirm the absence of a primary lesion in your nasopharynx. We then performed immunohistochemistry staining on formalin-fixed paraffin sections to confirm the diagnosis. The tumor cells were strongly positive for CK5/6 and P40, which helped us exclude large-cell lymphoma. In addition, the tumor cells showed negative immunostaining of Napsin A, TTF1, CD56, CgA, and Syn, further excluding the possibilities of lung adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma.
Patient: So what exactly is the diagnosis?
Doctor: We found that the latent membrane protein (LMP1) expression of the Epstein-Barr virus was positive in the tumor cells. We also performed chemiluminescence analysis of EB virus antibodies, which showed that EBV-EA IgA and EBV-VCA IgG were both positive. This confirms that your tumor is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus.
Patient: I see. What's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: We will discuss your case with our team and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. We will keep you informed throughout the process and ensure that you receive the best care possible. It is important to monitor your symptoms and follow-up with us for regular check-ups as well.

49,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I had squamous cell cancer of the lower lip back in 2013.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about the treatment you received for that?
Patient: I had a complete resection, including plastic reconstruction of the lip and vermillionectomy, as well as submental lymph node resection on both sides.
Doctor: What did the histology report show after the surgery?
Patient: It demonstrated that there was infiltration of a moderately differentiated squamous cell cancer, with muscle invasion. But the margins were negative, and there were no signs of metastases.
Doctor: So, the initial tumor stage was pT1, pN0, which means no adjuvant therapy was needed. Now, have you experienced any symptoms since then?
Patient: In May 2015, I had a swelling in my right cheek. The biopsy confirmed a relapse with submandibular lymph node metastases on the right side.
Doctor: What treatment did you receive for that relapse?
Patient: I had a neck dissection, level I-V on the right side, and level I-III on the left side. Then I had radiotherapy, 63 Gy on the right side, and 54 Gy on the left side.
Doctor: How did you tolerate the therapy? Were there any symptoms?
Patient: The therapy was well-tolerated, and I didn't have any relevant clinical symptoms.
Doctor: Great. What happened during your routine follow-up in December 2015?
Patient: A local relapse with new lymph node manifestations on the right side was confirmed. A whole body CT-scan showed no signs of metastases.
Doctor: It must have been difficult to hear that. What was the treatment plan for the new tumor manifestation?
Patient: The doctors said a complete resection was infeasible, so I started systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab.
Doctor: How did the tumor respond to the chemotherapy?
Patient: After four cycles, a neck MRI-scan revealed progressive disease.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Did they perform any further testing on the lymph node metastases from May 2015?
Patient: Yes, immunohistochemical staining showed that 25% of the tumor cells were positive for PD-L1, while the PD-1 expression was negative.
Doctor: Based on those findings, did they change your therapy?
Patient: Yes, they started me on nivolumab therapy in April 2016, with 3 mg/kg every 2nd week.
Doctor: How has your tumor responded to the nivolumab treatment?
Patient: After 6 administrations, restaging with CT and MRI showed no change in the tumor extension, so it's considered stable disease.
Doctor: It's good to hear that your disease is now stable. Please continue to follow up with your oncologist to monitor your condition, and let us know if you experience any new symptoms or changes in your health.","m at all.

Patient: Yes, I have a history of arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, left side breast cancer which was treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. I also have hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus type II.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking for your conditions?
Patient: I'm being treated with 10 mg/day of Dapagliflozin, 1000 mg of Metformin every 12 hours, and NPH insulin at 40 and 60 IU.
Doctor: Alright. What brings you in for consultation today?
Patient: I've been experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever recently.
Doctor: I see. Upon admission, I noticed that you're alert but tachypneic and experiencing diffuse abdominal pain. We'll need to do an abdominal ultrasound to get a better understanding of what's going on. 
(patient undergoes abdominal ultrasound)
Doctor: The abdominal ultrasound shows that your gallbladder has multiple gallstones. We also have your complete laboratory results. It seems you have leukocytosis, acute kidney failure, and severe metabolic acidosis.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, in this context, we have admitted you to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis. We also noticed the presence of metabolic acidosis with a gap of 32, so we requested a ketonemia test.
Patient: What were the results of the ketonemia test?
Doctor: The ketonemia test came back positive, so you have been diagnosed with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.
Patient: What does that mean for my treatment?
Doctor: We will start you on a continuous insulin infusion pump and administer water to help with the diabetic ketoacidosis. We'll closely monitor your progress in the ICU.
Patient: How long will I need to stay in the hospital?
Doctor: After 5 days of treatment, if everything goes well, you will be discharged from the hospital.

51,"Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 77-year-old obese Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with sudden lower chest and epigastric pain and collapse after lifting a heavy object on your ranch. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It was quite sudden and painful.
Doctor: I understand you were previously quite active and lost 50 pounds in the past year through a diet and exercise regimen. Your past medical history also includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. You were a former smoker from age 15 to 60, and you had a history of daily alcohol use, which ended in your mid-forties. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's all correct. I've been trying to take better care of myself in recent years.
Doctor: When you arrived at the emergency department, your initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 94/72 mmHg, a heart rate of 89 bpm, a respiratory rate of 16 BPM, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. During the physical exam, you appeared somnolent but easily aroused, pale, and in severe distress. Do you recall that?
Patient: Yeah, I remember feeling really out of it and in a lot of pain.
Doctor: Your cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. Your lungs were clear and without wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. The abdominal exam showed a soft, distended, and moderately tender epigastric region, but no rebound or guarding. We didn't detect a pulsatile mass or any abdominal bruits. 
Patient: Okay, that's good to know.
Doctor: Your initial complete blood count demonstrated a white count of 24.0 ×109/L, hemoglobin of 11,000 grams per liter, platelet count of 198 ×109/L, with 93% neutrophils. The comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable, and your creatine phosphokinase, troponin, amylase, and lipase levels were all normal.
Patient: I see. What does that mean?
Doctor: It means there were no significant abnormalities in your blood tests, which is a good sign. Your electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus rhythm with no acute ST changes and a right bundle branch block, which was also seen on a previous ECG.
Patient: Oh, alright.
Doctor: To further investigate, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest. We're currently waiting for the results, and we'll discuss them once they're available.

52,"Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented to our clinic with restricted movement in your left elbow. How long has this been going on?
Patient: Hi, doctor. It has been bothering me for about 9 months now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me if there was any history of trauma to your elbow?
Patient: Yes, I had an injury around the time it started, and I was treated by a local bonesetter.
Doctor: Okay, let's do a physical examination to assess the situation. *After examining* Your elbow is stiff in 40 degrees of flexion. I noticed a disruption in the three-point bony relationship between the olecranon tip and medial and lateral epicondyles, with the olecranon tip being prominent posteriorly and tenting of the triceps tendon. I didn't observe any neurologic deficit, which is good.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We'll need to do some further tests to have a better understanding of your condition. *After performing X-rays and CT scan* The X-rays show a posterior elbow dislocation with a displaced radial head fracture. The CT scan demonstrated the irreparable radial head fracture with an indented articular surface and deformation of the fracture ends. I also noted a tip fracture of the coronoid process (Reagan-Morrey type I).
Patient: So, what's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: The best course of action would be surgical treatment with open reduction of the elbow and radial head replacement. In this case, we'll use a custom-made anatomical radial head prosthesis instead of a commercial one due to limited availability in our country.
Patient: How will you create the custom prosthesis?
Doctor: We'll perform a high-resolution CT scanning of both your elbows using a Philips Brilliance 64 CT scanner. The images will be reconstructed into 3D images, and the affected side will be aligned with the mirrored image of the contralateral bone to identify the correct anatomic profile. Then, we'll use computer-aided design (CAD) to construct a 3D prosthesis model.
Patient: That sounds advanced. What's the purpose of this technique?
Doctor: This technique allows us to have accurate preoperative planning for the position of additional bone resection and extent of radial neck restoration. It also helps us design the stem configuration of the prosthesis.
Patient: Alright, doctor. I trust your judgment and hope this will help me regain my elbow function.
Doctor: Thank you for trusting us with your care. We'll do our best to ensure a successful treatment and recovery. We'll schedule the surgery and keep you informed about the next steps.","applying a mild sterile dressing to protect the area while we perform the operation.

53,"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 64-year-old male smoker who has been referred to our department for the management of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. You also have central airway obstruction and recurrent pulmonary infections. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: It seems that immunohistochemistry results showed a strong positive expression of PD-L1 in over 50% of the tumor cells, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Have you been experiencing recurrent episodes of pneumonia related to atelectasis of the right lung?
Patient: Yes, I have had pneumonia several times, and it's been really hard to breathe.
Doctor: I see. Your recent chest CT scan performed at the admission shows a severe stricture of the right main bronchus, with atelectasis of the middle lobe and pneumonia of the right lower lobe. Your severe acute respiratory distress and poor performance status (ECOG 3) are concerning.
Patient: Oh, that's not good.
Doctor: Although Pembrolizumab is indicated as the first therapeutic option for your condition, it's unfeasible due to the recurrent episodes of obstructive pneumonia of the right lung. So, after a multimodal assessment, we've decided to schedule you for endoscopic recanalization of the right main bronchus before starting ICI treatment. 
Patient: Okay, what does that procedure involve?
Doctor: The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia. You will be intubated with an 8.5 mm rigid bronchoscope. Your right main bronchus is currently completely obstructed by the tumor at the level of the carina. We will use mechanical coring with rigid bronchoscopy, debulking with forceps, and control of bleeding with an Nd:YAP laser to resect the tumor and obtain the complete recanalization of the right main bronchus and the middle and lower bronchus.
Patient: I see. What happens after that?
Doctor: After the recanalization, we will insert a fully covered SEMS (size: 14 mm diameter; 40 mm length) into the right main bronchus to maintain airway patency. This should help alleviate your dyspnea.
Patient: And when can I expect to be discharged after the procedure?
Doctor: Typically, the dyspnea should disappear the day after the procedure, and you can expect to be discharged three days later.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. We will do our best to ensure a successful procedure and help you manage your condition. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.","flammation when palpating them.

54,"Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you've been smoking a pack a day and drinking alcohol regularly for over 20 years. Can you tell me about your respiratory and abdominal symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've had multiple episodes of mild upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis almost every year since my early twenties. I also experienced abdominal discomfort and nausea that would come and go sporadically.
Doctor: I understand. We performed a high-resolution computed tomography of your chest, and it confirmed emphysematous changes in your lungs. Additionally, your liver enzymes have been slowly trending up. Over the span of a few months, your aspartate transaminase (AST) level increased from 52 units per liter (U/L) to 58 U/L, and your alanine transaminase (ALT) level increased from 81 U/L to 86 U/L. The upper limit of normal for both AST and ALT levels fall in the low 40s U/L. Other markers of liver damage, such as serum prothrombin concentrations and serum albumin, were not affected.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Your primary care physician instructed you to quit smoking and drinking, eat healthily, and exercise regularly. How have you been doing with those lifestyle changes?
Patient: I've been successful in making those changes, but my liver enzymes remained elevated and my lungs still showed persistent emphysema.
Doctor: I see. There has been little to no improvement in your overall symptoms due to these abnormal findings. We tested you for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and found that you are homozygous for the Z allele (PI*ZZ). Your alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) level is 18, which is well below the protective threshold of 57.
Patient: So, what's the plan now, doc?
Doctor: We have started you on weekly Prolastin infusions to help with your condition. You have completed eight infusions so far and will continue to receive them for as long as you're able to tolerate them.
Patient: Okay, I hope these infusions help improve my condition. Thanks for explaining everything to me, doctor.","dose per month at first, then gradually increase to two doses each month. Be sure to follow all prescribed instructions and report any adverse events or side effects immediately.

Patient: Yeah, the pain and bleeding started two days ago. Before that, I had these weird purpuric spots on my lower limbs and forearms.
Doctor: I understand. Did you have any other health issues recently?
Patient: About a week ago, I had a viral episode that affected my nasopharyngeal sphere.
Doctor: Okay. At the time of your admission, were you experiencing any fever or joint pain?
Patient: No, I didn't have any fever or joint pain.
Doctor: Good to know. Our physical examination revealed that your abdomen is compressible and painless, and your peristalsis is preserved. The laboratory blood tests were mostly normal, but we did find an elevated IgA level. We also noticed some subtle signs of glomerular damage, such as microscopic hematuria, mild proteinuria, and mixed cellular urinary casts.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We performed a rectosigmoidoscopy, which was normal except for some rare bloodstains. We also did a gastroscopy and found diffuse duodenal small necrotic ulcers.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: We then conducted a contrast-enhanced multidetector-row CT, which demonstrated homogenous circumferential bowel thickening in a long segment of your ileum terminal. The typical ""target sign"" pattern was present, with hypodense edema of the submucosa contrasting with hyperemia or hyperperfusion of the mucosa. We also noticed engorgement of the ileocecal mesenteric vessels with a typical comb sign.
Patient: Okay, and what about my colon?
Doctor: The CT showed hypodense thickening of your cecum and proximal ascending colonic wall, with a very sharp demarcation between the thickened and normal colonic wall on both conventional CT views and virtual endoscopic views. We also found a small amount of ascite in your pelvic floor and perihepatic space.
Patient: What's causing all of these issues?
Doctor: We performed a skin biopsy, which revealed typical signs of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Based on these findings, we have diagnosed you with Henoch-Schönlein purpura with gastrointestinal involvement.
Patient: What's the treatment for that?
Doctor: We will treat you with a combination of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Your gastrointestinal symptoms should resolve within two days, and we will monitor you for any recurrence of symptoms.

Parent: Yes, she has been having difficulty breathing, with a respiratory rate of 35-40/min. She sweats a lot during breastfeeding and has peripheral cyanosis. Her chest cavity also seems to indraw with each breath.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. We performed a physical examination and a Chest X-ray, which revealed cardiomegaly. Then, we conducted a transthoracic echocardiography that showed a massive pericardial effusion with a space-occupying mass lesion, 5 × 4 cm in size, in the pericardial cavity on the right side. Based on her condition and the echocardiographic findings, we scheduled her for emergency tumor removal.
Parent: Oh no! What can we expect during the surgery?
Doctor: During the surgery, we will closely monitor her heart rate, which has been between 130-140 bpm, and her peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2). Before induction, her SpO2 was 88% and after administering 100% oxygen with a mask, it rose to 94%. Due to her age, severe respiratory distress, and cardiovascular instability, we will perform awake-sedate intubation after giving her 5 μg of fentanyl and topicalizing her tongue, larynx, and vocal cords with 15 mg of 1.0% lidocaine and a 3.0-mm Portex tracheal tube.
Parent: And how will you maintain her anesthesia during the surgery?
Doctor: We will maintain her general anesthesia with a mixture of oxygen/air, isoflurane, 1-mg increments of atracurium, and 5 μg of fentanyl intermittently. We will also establish an arterial line and a central venous line for monitoring. We will use other monitoring modalities such as the bispectral index (BIS), capnograph, and pulse oximetry to ensure her safety during the procedure. Extracorporeal circulation will be on standby in case of any complications.
Parent: What happens during the actual tumor removal?
Doctor: We will perform a median sternotomy with the preservation of the thymus gland. Upon opening the pericardium, we will aspirate a large quantity of cloudy yellow fluid. Then, we will remove the multicystic lesion, which is around 50 × 45 × 30 mm in size. It currently covers most of the right ventricle and presses on the right atrium. The mass is polycystic and attached to the right anterior wall of the heart. Our goal is to remove the mass and relieve the pressure on her heart.

Patient: I work as a mason, but I haven't been exposed to any toxic conditions that I know of. I don't have any promiscuous sexual behavior, I don't consume alcohol, and I don't smoke tobacco.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. On examination, you appear emaciated, febrile, and pale. I can feel bilateral, firm, matted lymph nodes of varying sizes, about 2-3 cm, in your cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions, which are tender. There's also tender hepatosplenomegaly. We'll need to run some tests to better understand what's going on.
(After running the tests)
Doctor: Your laboratory investigations show high white cell counts with normocytic anemia. Your platelets are within the normal range. Your inflammatory markers are high and have been in a rising trend since the onset of arthritis. Your liver and renal functions are normal. Your rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-nuclear antibodies, HIV 1 and 2 antibodies, Epstein-Barr virus IgG, and immunoglobulin G tests are all negative.

Patient: I was doing well until about six days after the surgery. I suddenly felt feverish and really unwell.
Doctor: Yes, I see here that on postoperative day six, you became febrile with a temperature of 102 °F, and your white cell count rose to 21 k/mm3. We performed a chest computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed an anastomotic leak and a loculated abscess formation. 
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What did you do to treat it?
Doctor: We inserted a chest tube to drain the abscess, control the leak, and obtain microbiological cultures. We also started you on broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage, including metronidazole 500 mg intravenous every eight hours and ceftriaxone 2 g intravenous every 24 hours.
Patient: I remember having an Esophagogastroscopy too. What did that show?
Doctor: The Esophagogastroscopy revealed a 1-cm disruption at the gastroesophageal anastomosis. To address this, our gastroenterologist deployed a 23-French (diameter), 8-cm (length) fully covered metal stent to cover the leaking area.
Patient: Did my condition improve after that?
Doctor: Yes, your condition dramatically improved after the stent placement. Your temperature and white count normalized. We conducted an Esophagogram a week later, which demonstrated control of the leak.

Doctor: We've taken some blood tests, and the results show a low hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, a raised leukocyte count of 28,000/mm3, low albumin of 2.2 g/dL, raised serum creatinine of 2.23 mg/dL, serum urea of 174 mg/dL, and low sodium of 125 mEq/L. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 95 mm/hour, and your procalcitonin level is 25.2 ng/mL. These results indicate an infection.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We've also done an X-ray of your chest, which appeared normal, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of your neck. The CECT revealed an irregular, well-defined, hypodense, non-enhancing area in your right parotid gland, with extension into the neck spaces, larynx, and subcutaneous planes. CECT of your chest revealed mild effusion in the bilateral pleural space secondary to acute infection, but no evidence of lymphadenopathy or osteomyelitis.
Patient: What does all of that mean?
Doctor: The findings suggest an infection that has spread to various areas. We also tested your pleural fluid with Ziehl-Neelsen staining, which was negative for acid-fast bacilli.
Patient: So what's the plan now?
Doctor: You'll be managed in the intensive care unit with ventilator support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. We've diagnosed you with acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis with multiple organ dysfunction syndromes due to an unknown cause of septicemia. You'll undergo multiple aggressive debridements of your neck and chest wall to remove the infected tissue.
Patient: That sounds intense, but I trust your judgment.
Doctor: We'll also perform a cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test to further investigate the cause of your septicemia. We're going to do everything we can to help you get better.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
[Patient eventually dies]
Doctor (to patient's family): I'm very sorry to inform you that despite our best efforts, your loved one has passed away. We did everything we could to treat the acute progressive necrotizing fasciitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, but the septicemia was too advanced. Our deepest condolences to you and your family during this difficult time.",
60,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're an 81-year-old man with a history of left total hip replacement, open discectomy at the L4/5 level more than 10 years prior, percutaneous coronary intervention 3 years prior, and periodontitis detected 1 month before presentation. Can you tell me more about your current symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been suffering from severe back pain for the last 2 days.
Doctor: I see. We did some plain lumbar spine radiographs which showed spondylosis but no signs of fractures. Additionally, your laboratory tests were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.2 × 104 cells/μl and C-reactive protein level of 13.8 mg/dl. Based on these findings, we admitted you for treatment.
Patient: Okay, so what happened after I was admitted?
Doctor: Two days after admission, we performed magnetic resonance imaging of your lumbar spine and discovered discitis at the L5/S level. To further investigate, we did punctures of the disc from both the left and right side under fluoroscopy and obtained two samples. We also collected two sets of blood cultures and urine cultures at the same time.
Patient: And what was the result of those tests?
Doctor: We started you on empiric therapy with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours and ceftriaxone 1 g every 24 hours combined with lumbosacral orthosis. After 6 days, the culture of the disc aspirate came back positive. The causative agent was identified as G. morbillorum based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis.
Patient: Were my blood and urine cultures positive too?
Doctor: No, both your blood and urine cultures were negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was also performed, and it showed no evidence of endocarditis.
Patient: So, what's the next step for my treatment?
Doctor: We couldn't perform the broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing because the isolate did not grow in the wells. Instead, we used the E-test method for determining susceptibility to penicillin G. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolate for penicillin G was 0.012 μg/ml, which was interpreted as susceptible.
Patient: Okay, so what does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that your infection is susceptible to penicillin G, and we can adjust your treatment accordingly. We will continue to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to keep you informed and work towards your recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.","e the first course of treatment. You should take one tablet of isoniazid daily until the completion of the third course.

61,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing epigastric pain for the past three years, and it's been getting worse in the last six months. I also feel nauseous after eating fatty foods.
Doctor: I see. Let's start by doing a complete blood count and some other tests to understand what might be causing your symptoms.
Patient: Okay, sure.
*After tests*
Doctor: Your test results show that your white blood count is 9550 cells/mm3, which is within the normal range of 4600–10200 cells/mm3, and your hematocrit level is 38%, which is slightly below the normal range of 40%–54%. Your electrolytes, liver function tests, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels are all normal.
Patient: Alright, so what does that mean?
Doctor: It means that we need to investigate further to find the cause of your symptoms. I'd like to perform an abdominal ultrasonography to get a better look at your internal organs.
Patient: Okay, let's do that.
*After ultrasonography*
Doctor: The ultrasonography detected a 7-mm polyp in your gallbladder. This could be the reason for your epigastric pain and nausea.
Patient: Oh, I see. What do you suggest we do next?
Doctor: Considering your symptoms and the presence of the polyp, I recommend that you undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is a minimally invasive surgery to remove your gallbladder.
Patient: If that's what you think is best, then let's do it.
*After the surgery*
Doctor: The surgery went well, and we were able to remove your gallbladder without any complications. You'll be discharged on the first postoperative day.
Patient: That's great news. Thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. The pathologic examination of the removed gallbladder showed an 8-mm polyp, which included mononuclear cell infiltration consistent with chronic cholecystitis, thickening in the gallbladder wall, fibrosis, and 6x4 mm heterotopic pancreatic tissue located in the submucosal area of the fundus.
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that the polyp and the associated changes in your gallbladder were likely the cause of your epigastric pain and nausea. Removing the gallbladder should help alleviate your symptoms.
Patient: That's a relief to hear. What's the plan for follow-up?
Doctor: We will schedule a three-month follow-up to ensure that there are no further complications and that your symptoms have improved.

62,"Doctor: Good morning! How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doc. I've been diagnosed with stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma. I was treated with 6 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed, followed by a maintenance regimen. But my cancer progressed after fourteen months, so I started second-line nivolumab treatment.
Doctor: I see. How has your experience been with the nivolumab treatment?
Patient: After thirteen doses of nivolumab, I started having irritated red eyes without any visual impairment. I don't have any skin issues, arthralgia, or urinary tract or digestive symptoms, though.
Doctor: Have you tried any treatments for the red eyes?
Patient: Yeah, I did a conjunctiva swab test, but it came back negative. I tried antibiotic ocular drops, but there was no improvement.
Doctor: It seems the ophthalmologist's examination revealed bilateral sterile conjunctivitis without any signs of uveitis or retinal lesions, as shown in Fig. a. They treated you with topical steroids, and you experienced partial improvement, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms recently?
Patient: A few days ago, I started feeling really tired and developed progressive dysphagia. It got really severe after two months, and I lost 10 kg in weight. But I don't have any colitis or gastritis symptoms.
Doctor: We need to consider a few possibilities for the cause of your dysphagia, such as esophageal infection, tumor progression with GI upper tract involvement, paraneoplastic syndrome, or an atypical checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse event. You mentioned you have no history of autoimmune disease, conjunctivitis, or upper digestive tract abnormality before the nivolumab treatment, right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your oral examination initially showed evidence for oral candidiasis, but a 7-day course of fluconazole didn't improve your dysphagia despite resolving the stomatitis. Additionally, the bacterial culture of your oropharyngeal swab was negative, as were PCR results for herpes simplex 1 and 2 infections. Your blood sample showed a slight increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) but no eosinophilia or leukocytosis. Your liver and kidney function panel tests were normal, and a thoracoabdominal CT scan reported no evidence of disease recurrence.
Patient: So, what's the next step, doc?
Doctor: Due to your fatigue, we'll implement a therapeutic break for one month and introduce prednisone at 30 mg per day, with rapid tapering over a month. We'll closely monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.","infectious disease consultation was scheduled and performed, and cultures from nasal secretion samples collected during your hospital stay revealed the presence of hsv type 3, which suggests possible genital herpes.

63,"Doctor: Hi there, I see that you came in for a screening upper endoscopy and have been diagnosed with thoracic superficial esophageal cancer, even though you had no symptoms. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension. I was also found to have a vascular abnormality called DAA as an adult, but I've been asymptomatic.
Doctor: I see. Your physical examinations showed no unusual findings. The laboratory examination data, including tumor markers like squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen, were all within normal ranges. Your chest X-ray demonstrated a widening in the upper mediastinal silhouette, reflecting the superior right aortic arch. 
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: An endoscopic examination revealed superficial esophageal cancer located in the left side of the wall in the upper thoracic esophagus and the invasion of the submucosa. A histological examination of biopsy specimens confirmed the presence of squamous cell carcinoma.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Enhanced computed tomography showed a swollen lymph node in the right upper mediastinum, which was diagnosed as metastatic. However, no distant metastasis was detected. Computed tomography also confirmed the DAA. The right aortic arch was dominant, and the descending aorta was located at the right side of the post-mediastinum, as is common in cases of DAA.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: Based on these findings, you've been diagnosed with upper thoracic esophageal cancer of cT1bN1M0 Stage IIB (UICC-TNM 7th) and a DAA. We'll start with neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to a sub-total esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy. The chemotherapy regimen will be 2 courses of 5-FU (800 mg/m2) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2) every 3 weeks.
Patient: Okay, and what's the plan after the chemotherapy?
Doctor: After the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we plan to perform a radical subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection. We'll first perform a cervical procedure in a supine position before the thoracic procedure to identify the bilateral inferior laryngeal nerves and avoid causing them injury or inducing palsy. We also plan to perform upper mediastinal lymph node dissection during this preceding procedure because the DAA is expected to interfere with upper mediastinal dissection.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. I hope the treatment goes well.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to ensure a successful treatment. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.","d to know.

64,"Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having a problem with progressive hearing loss. It's been getting worse, but I don't have any dizziness or vertigo.
Doctor: I see. Let's do a physical examination and a hearing test to understand the situation better. 
Patient: Sure.
[After the examination]
Doctor: Your physical examination is normal, without any nystagmus or eye deviation. However, the Rinne tuning fork test at 512 Hz came back negative. We'll need to do a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
Patient: Alright, let's do it.
[After the CT scan]
Doctor: The CT scan shows that you have bilateral otosclerosis and right-sided superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Your hearing loss is a mix of conductive and sensorineural. To treat the otosclerosis, we can perform a stapedectomy on your left ear, which should close the air-bone gap to less than 10 dB.
Patient: Okay, let's do the surgery.
[After the left-sided stapedectomy]
Doctor: The surgery was successful, and it confirmed the diagnosis of otosclerosis. How do you feel about your hearing now?
Patient: My left ear is much better. Can we do the same surgery on the right side?
Doctor: I would advise against it. Instead, I recommend using a hearing aid for your right ear. We can do an electro-physiological assessment, including vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, video nystagmography, and video head impulse test, to monitor your condition.
Patient: I think I'll avoid the surgery and use the hearing aid instead. Let's not do the physiological assessment for now.
Doctor: That's fine. We can keep monitoring your progress. I would like to see you for follow-up appointments every six months. The total follow-up duration should be 2 years.
Patient: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I'll see you in six months.","her changes or concerns, please contact me immediately. Remember, treatment options include cochlear implants, auditory neuroplasty, and facial nerve stimulation. If necessary, we will also consider using an external device such as the OtoCure device.
Patient: What does all of this mean?
Doctor: This procedure will help improve your hearing, but it may take some time before full recovery occurs. Regular checkups are essential to ensure proper management of your condition. Thank you again for coming in and allowing us to provide you with the best possible care.

65,"Doctor: Hello, I remember you underwent a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy recently. How have you been feeling since the surgery?
Patient: Hi, doctor. After the surgery, I had mild pain in my left iliac fossa. I was taking paracetamol and oral morphine for the pain.
Doctor: I see, and you have a history of total abdominal hysterectomy 20 years prior for endometriosis, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: During your recent surgery, there were adhesions obscuring the anatomy of your left ureter due to your prior surgery. In the early postoperative days, you didn't have any flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness, right?
Patient: No, I didn't. But one week later, I had severe left iliac fossa pain, nausea, and vomiting, so I went to the emergency department.
Doctor: Yes, I see that in your records. Your investigations showed a normal range of renal function and inflammatory markers. However, a contrast CT revealed extravasation of the contrast at the level of the left renal pelvis and ureteric dilatation down to the pelvic ureter.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Due to your recent pelvic surgery, an immediate diagnosis of left ureteric iatrogenic injury was made. You were then managed initially with urgent CT-guided nephrostomy insertion. However, you were in pain and an adequate nephrostogram was not performed during nephrostomy insertion.
Patient: Yeah, I remember that.
Doctor: Three weeks after the injury, you underwent a proper antegrade nephrostogram. The contrast extravasated into the peritoneal cavity, and there was no contrast passing into the distal left ureter. This led to a suspicion of complete transection of ureteric injury.
Patient: Oh no!
Doctor: The nephrostomy was left in situ, and you were planned for reconstructive surgery. Eleven weeks after the injury, you were admitted for your planned surgery.
Patient: Yes, I remember being admitted for the surgery.
Doctor: Before the surgery, a left retrograde study was performed. Surprisingly, the contrast went up to your left kidney, and there was only an annular stricture at the level of the injury.
Patient: That's a relief!
Doctor: Yes, so the decision was made for a ureteroscopic dilatation of the stricture. During the ureteroscopy, a small annular stricture, less than 0.5 cm, was found. It was easily passed over the safety guidewire, and a ureteric stent, size 8 French, was inserted.
Patient: So everything should be okay now?
Doctor: Yes, it appears the procedure was successful, and your ureteric injury has been addressed. We'll continue to monitor your progress during follow-up appointments. If you experience any new symptoms or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","nt: Wow, what about my recovery?

Doctor: Thank you for the information. Do you smoke or have a history of alcohol consumption?
Patient: No, I'm a non-smoker and I don't drink alcohol.
Doctor: And are you currently pregnant?
Patient: Yes, I'm 22 weeks pregnant.
Doctor: Hmm, okay. In consultation with the doctor in charge of obstetrics and gynecology, we have decided to use certain drugs for your perioperative management. These include cefazolin or cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride as antibiotics and flurbiprofen axetil and diclofenac sodium as analgesics.
Patient: Alright, what's the next step?
Doctor: At 25 weeks of pregnancy, we will perform a trans-oral partial glossectomy under general anesthesia. A pathologic examination will then be conducted to confirm the diagnosis.
Patient: What kind of anesthesia will be used?
Doctor: We will use remifentanil hydrochloride, thiamylal sodium, and sevoflurane for anesthetic induction, and remifentanil hydrochloride and oxygen in air for maintenance of general anesthesia. Lidocaine 1% with adrenaline (epinephrine) 1:300,000 will be used for local anesthesia.
Patient: And what about postoperative care?
Doctor: To prevent postoperative infection, we'll administer cefazolin and cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride. Acetaminophen will be used for analgesia. We will also use ultrasonic examination to monitor the fetus intraoperatively.
Patient: How long will the operation take?
Doctor: The operation time will be around 1 hour and 13 minutes, and the anesthesia time will be approximately 2 hours and 22 minutes.
Patient: What can I expect after the operation?
Doctor: Your postoperative course should be uneventful, and you should be able to deliver a healthy baby about four months after the operation.
Patient: That's a relief. How likely is it that the disease will come back?
Doctor: Based on your current condition, the chances of recurrence are low. Six years after the final operation, you should still be free of the disease.

Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms or changes in your health?
Patient: Yes, I was sexually active up until last year, but my libido has decreased. I've also been dealing with disturbed sleep, back pain, right ear deafness, and urge incontinence for years.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Can you tell me about your medical history, including any conditions or surgeries you've had?
Patient: Sure. I developed menopause in my early 50s. I have a history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, tonsillectomy, and tubal ligation. My family has a history of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, malignant neoplasm of the urinary bladder, malignant melanoma of the skin, myelodysplastic syndrome, and sudden death.
Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. I'd like to conduct a clinical examination now. *After the examination* Your blood pressure is 132/76 mmHg, and your heart rate is 64 beats per minute. I noticed that you seem anxious and overweight, with a BMI of 38.06. I also observed an enlarged thyroid gland, clitoromegaly, male pattern baldness, and hirsutism. I'd like to run some laboratory tests to further investigate.
Patient: Okay, let me know when the results come in.
Doctor: *After receiving the lab results* Your lab results show normal urea (27 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.45 mg/dL), elevated testosterone (210 ng/dL; normal range is 12-72 ng/dL), raised DHEA-S (235 μg/dL), hyperlipidemia, normal TSH (1.09 IU/mL), LH, FSH, and estradiol levels. We also conducted an abdominal ultrasound scan and uterine echotexture, which were normal, and a Pap smear that was negative.
Patient: What about any scans of my brain?
Doctor: We performed a CT scan of your brain which showed a normal pituitary gland. An MRI of your brain and internal auditory canal revealed a 2.1 x 1.1 x 1 x 1 cm right acoustic schwannoma in the internal auditory canal, with extension into the cerebellopontine angle cistern. It also involves the right cochlea and the vestibule, but there's no evidence of a pituitary tumor or brain compression.
Patient: So, what's the next step in my treatment?
Doctor: We did a trial of Leuprolide, and your elevated testosterone levels have settled. We've diagnosed you with hyperandrogenism, and the recommended treatment is a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
Patient: What does the surgery involve?
Doctor: It's a laparoscopic procedure where we'll remove both of your fallopian tubes and ovaries. In your case, the surgery revealed a left stromal luteoma, which is a benign ovarian tumor.

Patient: Okay, doctor. What's the next step then?
Doctor: The next step is for you to undergo an incomplete excision of the mass. This will help us study it and determine the best course of action.
Patient: Alright, so what happened after the excision?
Doctor: After the excision, we examined the mass and the initial histopathological findings documented that it is a sinonasal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. This is a type of cancer that occurs in the nasal cavity.
Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What do we do next?
Doctor: Don't worry, we will take care of it. The next step is for you to undergo an endoscopic craniofacial resection and reconstruction. This procedure will remove the cancerous cells and reconstruct the affected area.
Patient: I understand. Please go ahead with the procedure.
Doctor: The procedure was successful. However, due to the complex tumor presentation, we decided to send the tumor sample for further analysis. Specifically, we performed a FISH cytogenetics: ESW-FLI-1 fusion analysis.
Patient: What does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: The fusion analysis helps us to better understand the genetic makeup of the tumor. This information can be useful in determining the most effective treatment options for you.

Patient: Yes, my SCr level was 1222 umol/L, and my BUN was 24.33 mmol/L. My blood pressure was really high too, at 180/100 mmHg.
Doctor: That's correct. At that time, you were waiting for a renal transplantation. You were readmitted to the hospital on Jan 5, 2016, and then received a kidney allograft the next day. The procedure was performed with routine ZHIB, as shown in Fig. a. After the surgery, you were given standard triple immunosuppression and HD. How did you feel after the surgery?
Patient: Hmm, I remember the follow-up assessments were done almost every day, but the course was not very favorable.
Doctor: Yes, unfortunately, you experienced DGF emerging. An USG-guided renal graft biopsy was performed on post-op day 75, which documented acute TCMR (2015 Banff 2A) and extensive deposits of CaOx crystals in the interstitial tubule, as seen in Fig. b and c (200X HE and polarized light). Based on the absence of oxalate crystals in the ZHIB and your history of kidney stones, the recurrence of CaOx nephropathy following kidney transplantation was confirmed. This led to the diagnosis of PH. However, the diagnosis of PH must depend on genetic testing. Were you able to undergo the genetic testing?
Patient: Unfortunately, no. I didn't have the molecular genetic testing to identify the PV in AGXT, GRHPR, or HOGA1 for some reasons.
Doctor: I see. Although your renal function was slowly repairing (SCr 260 umol/L; BUN 14 mmol/L), the treatment with HD was not effective in treating excess oxalate, in addition to drug immunosuppression. Did you have any other symptoms at that time?
Patient: Yes, I had a high fever of 39.8 °C and an intermittent cough.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's essential to closely monitor your renal function and follow up with your healthcare provider to manage your condition effectively. Do you have any questions?

Patient: Yes, they submitted a PCR panel testing for Mycoplasma haemofelis, Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis, and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemomintum.
Doctor: While waiting for the PCR results, did your cat receive any treatment?
Patient: Yes, the vet prescribed orbifloxacin at 3.4 mg/kg by mouth once daily and some oral vitamin B supplementation. But I'm not sure about the type and dose of the vitamin B.
Doctor: How did your cat respond to the treatment?
Patient: A week later, the CBC showed improved normocytic and normochromic anemia and reticulocytosis with 21% hematocrit and 94,600 reticulocytes/μl. The thrombocytopenia also resolved with 159,000 platelets/μl.
Doctor: And what were the results of the PCR panel?
Patient: The PCR panel came back negative.
Doctor: Did your cat continue the orbifloxacin and vitamin B supplementation?
Patient: Yes, the vet decided to continue the treatment since there was clinical improvement.
Doctor: How has your cat's anemia progressed over the past two weeks?
Patient: The packed cell volume has been ranging from 20.1–22.5% and the reticulocyte count has been between 58,000–80,600 reticulocytes/μl.

72,"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you've been referred for orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery to correct your tooth position and jaw relations. Can you tell me about any previous treatments you've had?
Patient: Yeah, I've been offered surgical treatments to correct my appearance, like tooth correction and chin augmentation. But they didn't seem good enough for what I wanted.
Doctor: Alright, let's discuss your general medical history. Are there any limitations or serious illnesses that might affect orthodontic therapy combined with surgery?
Patient: No, I don't have any serious illness. I just have a limping walk because of some past injuries.
Doctor: I see. It's important to be honest about your health condition, as it affects the treatment plan. Have you ever withheld any information about your underlying disease or medication?
Patient: To be honest, I did make inaccurate statements about my health before. I was refused treatment for my tooth anomalies when I told them about my underlying disease and medication.
Doctor: Thank you for being honest now. Let's move on to your physical examination. I notice you have a relatively short stature and an asymmetrically developed face. Your maxilla seems to have hypoplasia in the sagittal plane. Have you ever noticed a slightly bluish tint in your sclera?
Patient: Hmm, I didn't really pay attention to it until you mentioned it.
Doctor: In our intraoral examination, we found a class III occlusion. Is your permanent dentition complete, including wisdom teeth?
Patient: Yes, all my teeth are there.
Doctor: Good. I also observed that your front teeth have increased translucency upon frontal illumination, specifically around the incisal edges and proximal areas. Are there any attritions of occlusal surfaces that exceed age-appropriate wear and tear?
Patient: No, there aren't any.
Doctor: Thank you for providing all this information. Considering your later diagnosed condition and relevant medical reports, the dental findings do not suggest any clues for DI. We will work on creating a suitable treatment plan to address your orthodontic and surgical needs.","Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Please come back for follow-up appointments at 6 months after completion of treatment. If you experience any new symptoms during the procedure, please inform us immediately so we can address them promptly. Remember, maintaining regular checkups is crucial for optimal results.

73,"Doctor: Hello! How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I was recently diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ and I'm here to discuss my imaging results.
Doctor: I understand. Let me take a look at your imaging report. It seems that the parameters used for your imaging were: voltage at 30 kV, tube current at 61, and thickness at 46 mm. There were 15 projections, and the AGD was 1.75. Can you tell me if you've experienced any symptoms related to this condition?
Patient: I've noticed a lump in my breast and some discomfort.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a non-invasive breast cancer, which means it hasn't spread beyond the milk ducts. The imaging parameters used in your case will help us to further evaluate the extent of the carcinoma and plan your treatment accordingly.
Patient: Hmm, okay. So what do these numbers mean? Like the voltage and tube current?
Doctor: Good question. The voltage, 30 kV, and tube current, 61, are settings used during your mammogram to produce a clear image of your breast tissue. These values help to ensure that we get an accurate picture of the carcinoma for proper diagnosis and treatment planning.
Patient: I see. And what about the thickness and AGD?
Doctor: The thickness of 46 mm represents the size of your breast during the imaging process. The AGD, or average glandular dose, which was 1.75 in your case, refers to the amount of radiation your breast tissue received during the mammogram. This value is kept as low as possible while still providing clear images for diagnosis.
Patient: Oh, I understand now. So, what are the next steps for me?
Doctor: Based on your imaging results and symptoms, we'll need to discuss your treatment options, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, or hormone therapy. We'll consider factors like your overall health, preferences, and the specific characteristics of your carcinoma to determine the best course of action for you.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining all of this to me, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to support you through this process.
Patient: Thank you, I appreciate that.","nostic tests and treatments mentioned earlier. im concerned about the accuracy and safety of those procedures.
doctor: i apologise for any confusion this might have caused. our team has been working hard to improve patient outcomes through better quality care and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.
patient: thats good to hear. so, what kind of data did they collect from my mammography?
doctor: we collected various data points throughout your examination, including physical measurements such as breast volume and bone density, ultrasound findings, and biopsies taken during the procedure. we also evaluated the presence of any suspicious lesions by assessing the morphology and color of each tumor using histopathological analysis.
patient: i see. how long did it take to complete all these evaluations?
doctor: its typically only a few days for us to gather all the necessary data to provide you with a comprehensive evaluation. we strive to deliver high-quality patient care within our established timelines."
74,"Doctor: Hello, I understand you've developed some issues with your visual acuity in your right eye for about a month now. Can you describe the symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yes, Doctor. My vision in my right eye has been getting worse, and it's been really blurry.
Doctor: I see. We've conducted a dilated fundus examination (Fig. a) and FA (Fig. a-b) to get a better understanding of your condition. The results showed that your BCVA in the right eye is 20/200. We also found an infra-temporal RAM, with surrounding stellate-shaped exudates involving the fovea.
Patient: Oh, that sounds concerning.
Doctor: We also performed an OCT angiogram (Fig. b) which confirmed the RAMs and revealed a heliciform capillary mass in the superficial layer, segmented with an inner boundary at 3 μm beneath the internal limiting membrane and an outer boundary at 15 μm beneath the inner plexiform layer. Additionally, an OCT scan (Fig. c-d) showed SRD through the fovea.
Patient: What does that mean for my vision?
Doctor: The good news is that your vision improved to 20/70 after the first intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab (Fig. e). There was also an increase in hard exudate around your fovea (Fig. f-h) and resolution of the SRD.
Patient: That's a relief!
Doctor: We decided to continue treatment with a therapy regimen used for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by administering a second intravitreal injection of ranibizumab. One month after the second injection, the hard exudate diminished (Fig. i-l) and your BCVA improved to 20/50.
Patient: Wow, that's great news!
Doctor: At the one-year follow-up, the final fundus examination (Fig. m) and FA (Fig. c-d) confirmed the complete absorption of the hemorrhage and the atrophy of the RAM. The OCT angiography showed that the capillary mass in the RAM disappeared (Fig. n).
Patient: So, what does that mean for my eye now?
Doctor: The macular anatomy maintained a normal appearance without SRD at the final visit (Fig. o-p). This means that the treatment has been successful and your eye should continue to improve.
Patient: That's fantastic! Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome! If you have any concerns or if your symptoms return, please don't hesitate to come back for a visit. Take care!","y measures to ensure your safety and wellbeing during this treatment process.

75,"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been experiencing some pain, irritability, and difficulty with mobilization. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, I've noticed some swelling and erythema over my little girl's interphalangeal joints.
Doctor: I see. I can confirm that your daughter has polyarthritis affecting her hands and wrists. She's also been referred to a rheumatologist. Has she been displaying any other symptoms, such as a hoarse voice?
Patient: Yes, she has a hoarse voice.
Doctor: It appears that she has right vocal cord paresis and gastroesophageal reflux as well. She's the second child to a nonconsanguineous healthy caucasian couple, correct?
Patient: That's right.
Doctor: At the age of 4 months, did she develop erythematous nodules over multiple areas of her body?
Patient: Yes, she did.
Doctor: We suspect a diagnosis of Farber Disease (FD). Genetic testing revealed that she carries a homozygous mutation (c.458A > G [p.Tyr153Cys]) in the ASAH1 gene. We've conducted a neurological assessment and found signs of mild delay in her gross and fine motor skills, which we believe is secondary to her arthritis.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: To further assess her neurological status, we performed electroencephalography, which was unremarkable, and electromyography (EMG), which showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or myopathy.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done prior to her transplant, and it came back unremarkable. Her initial ophthalmologic examination 4 months prior to transplant was normal. However, one cherry-red spot was identified on reassessment a few days prior to transplant.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: She received a myeloablative conditioning regimen with targeted IV busulfan, fludarabine, and alemtuzumab, followed by a matched (6/6) unrelated cord blood transplant at the age of 9 months.
Patient: How did it go?
Doctor: The transplant went well. Cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were used as graft vs host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. She had no significant transplant-related complications and had a full recovery of all three cell lines. No signs of acute or chronic GvHD were reported.
Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you for all the information, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We'll continue to monitor her progress and provide any necessary follow-up care.",inicians observed progressive improvement in her FD symptom score from baseline (FDS = -14; baseline n = 5) to post-transplant scores of -6.7 (post-transplant n = 4) and finally to an average of 2 points (average n = 2) 4 months following her transplant.
76,"Doctor: Hi there, I see in your records that you were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 10 years ago. How have you been managing it so far?
Patient: Hmm, yes, I've been taking glimepiride and metformin for a long time, but I recently ran out of the medicine before my scheduled appointment.
Doctor: I noticed that your body weight is 41.7 kg with a BMI of 20.1 kg/m2. Your liver function, with an AST of 24 IU/mL, and renal function, with a creatinine of 0.68 mg/dL, seem to be normal. And it looks like you haven't had any diabetic complications so far, which is good.
Patient: That's a relief to hear.
Doctor: However, I must ask, have you been experiencing any cognitive decline recently?
Patient: Yes, I've been a bit forgetful lately.
Doctor: It seems like there might have been an overdose of glimepiride and metformin due to your cognitive decline, so we decided to discontinue those drugs. We prescribed you teneligliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which has a lower risk of hypoglycemia. How has that been working for you?
Patient: Well, my blood sugar hasn't been great. I think it's gotten worse.
Doctor: Yes, I see that your hemoglobin A1c levels increased to 10.2% within 6 months. Considering your situation, we decided to administer 2 mg of exenatide-LAR once weekly to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia caused by overdosing. Have you been coming in for your injections?
Patient: Yes, I've been visiting the clinic weekly for the exenatide-LAR injections.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Your HbA1c level rapidly decreased, and after 4 months, it reached 7.1%. Moreover, good blood glucose control was achieved.
Patient: Oh, that's great news!
Doctor: To make things easier for you, we extended the dose interval to 2 weeks and then to 1 month. When you were receiving exenatide-LAR every 2 weeks, your HbA1c level was in the 6% range. And for more than 2 years with once-monthly administration, it was in the 7% range. Fasting glucose just before the next injection did not rise, which is a positive sign.
Patient: That's really helpful. I can manage the injections much more easily now.
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. Unfortunately, it seems that outpatient treatment has become difficult for you recently. We'll need to discuss alternatives to ensure you continue receiving the care you need.
Patient: Okay, I understand. Let's figure out what's best for me moving forward.",

Patient: My family brought me here because of worsening confusion that started 3 days ago. They say I've been acting strange and sending them gibberish text messages.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other changes in yourself?
Patient: Yeah, I've been very quiet lately and having trouble finding words. My speech doesn't make any sense, and I seem to be indifferent and inattentive at times. I've also had urinary incontinence.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, diplopia, or seizure activity recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms.
Doctor: What about any skin rash or ulcers? I see that you like to garden in your free time.
Patient: No, I don't have any skin rash or ulcers.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing this information. We have conducted a general physical examination, and everything seems to be unremarkable. You appear well-nourished, and your vital signs are within normal limits. We also conducted an ophthalmological examination which showed bilateral 3 mm reactive pupils with full conjugate extraocular movements. There was no nystagmus or ptosis. Your visual acuity was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: The funduscopic examination revealed slightly blurred disk margins on the left, with sharp disk margins on the right. The retinal vascularity was normal. You were alert and cooperative during the examination. You were oriented to yourself and time but not to place. You could add simple numbers but had difficulty with serial seven subtractions and were slow to spell ""world"" backward.
Patient: Yes, that's true.
Doctor: Your speech was fluent but with intermittent misuse of words and expressive dysphasia. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 were intact, except for a right eyelid droop. Your motor examination showed a slight pronator drift of the right arm. You had 5/5 muscle power in the upper and lower extremities, and your deep tendon reflexes were symmetric.
Patient: So, what does all this mean, doc?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and examination results, it seems that you are experiencing some cognitive and speech difficulties. We will need to run some more tests to determine the cause of your confusion and other symptoms. In the meantime, it's important to keep an eye on your symptoms, and let us know if anything changes or worsens.

78,"Doctor: Hello, Ms. K. What brings you in today?
Ms. K: Hi, doctor. I've been having watery eyes, chest pain, lower back and joint pain, leg cramps, and weakness lately.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss your medical history to better understand your symptoms. I can see that you first visited a cardiologist in 2013 with intermittent episodes of chest pain over six months. An electrocardiogram was done, and it showed bradycardia, a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and a left bundle branch block. Do you recall this?
Ms. K: Yes, I remember that visit. I also mentioned some non-specific complaints, which I thought were because of a ""hematological problem.""
Doctor: I see. You were later evaluated for renal hypertension, and imaging studies showed a renal cyst. Did you follow up with a nephrologist?
Ms. K: No, I didn't. But I continued to make hospital visits for persistent chest pain, and every time, they said everything was normal.
Doctor: I understand. I also see a note in your prior medical records mentioning the disappearance of your kidneys. Can you tell me more about that?
Ms. K: Well, I claimed that the Russian military entered my residence and stole my urine, which resulted in my kidneys disappearing.
Doctor: That must have been distressing for you. It's important to note that our medical team found no evidence of missing kidneys. Now, I want to address your current concerns. You seem to have delusions about having high blood pressure, uterine cancer, blood cancer with bone metastasis, and brain cancer with extensive metastasis. Can you tell me why you believe you have these conditions?
Ms. K: I'm convinced I have cancer because I used to be a practicing neurologist in my home country. I also think my doctors, both here and back home, are hiding the truth about my oncological issues.
Doctor: It's important to trust your medical team, Ms. K. We're here to help you. I must say, you've had a full medical workup during your hospital visits, and everything was found to be normal. Do you remember the incident where you threatened to burn down your primary doctor's office?
Ms. K: Yes, I was angry and felt that my doctors were not taking my concerns seriously. I didn't actually want to harm anyone.
Doctor: I understand your frustration, but it's important to handle these situations appropriately. Now, you've vehemently denied having any psychiatric illness, stating that these diagnoses appeared on your records because of a rumor started by an envious former colleague. Is that correct?
Ms. K: Yes, that's what I believe.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing your perspective, Ms. K. Given your symptoms and history, I recommend further evaluation to rule out any underlying medical conditions. However, it's also essential to consider the possibility of a psychiatric component to your symptoms. I'll arrange a follow-up appointment for you with a specialist to address your concerns. In the meantime, please let us know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms.

79,"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 12-year-old female who recently presented to the local emergency room with persistent intense left flank pain. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, the pain was really bad and it wouldn't go away.
Doctor: I see. In the emergency room, a dipstick test showed large blood, and an abdominal CT revealed a 4 mm obstructing calculus in your proximal left ureter, nephrolithiasis with minimal scarring in the upper pole of your left kidney, and multiple bilateral renal cysts. The dominant cyst on your left kidney measured 2.8 mm. They also identified non-calcified 2 mm nodules in your right lower lobe of the lung. Your renal function was preserved with a BUN of 11 mg/dl and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dl, and your electrolytes were within the normal range. Were you treated with any medications for pain control and hydration?
Patient: Yes, they gave me some pain control medications and I felt better after getting some hydration.
Doctor: That's good to hear. You were then referred to a nephrologist, who conducted a 24-hour urine ""stone risk study"" and a renal ultrasound (RUS). The RUS showed multiple bilateral cysts and renal calculi in your kidneys. The right kidney measured 10.5 cm × 4.9 cm × 4.8 cm and the left kidney measured 9.8 cm × 4.7 cm × 5.0 cm. Renal cysts were present bilaterally, with some displaying thick internal septation (Bosniak type II renal cyst). The largest cyst was in your left kidney, measuring 3.3 mm. There were no solid masses present. An extrarenal pelvis was present on the left, but there was no caliectasis. Are you following me so far?
Patient: Yeah, I think so.
Doctor: The 24-hour urine ""stone study"" showed elevated levels of calcium oxalate, brushite, and monosodium urate. Since you have a strong family history of kidney issues, with both your father and paternal grandmother having a history of never genetically tested ADPKD, and considering the radiological and clinical findings, you underwent genetic testing for PKD1, PKD2, GANAB, and HNF1B. The genomic DNA from the submitted specimens was captured and sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) on an Illumina platform. 
Patient: So, what does all that mean, doc?
Doctor: It means that we have conducted thorough testing to better understand your kidney condition, considering your family history and the symptoms you have been experiencing. The genetic testing will help us determine if you have any genetic predispositions for kidney disorders. We will discuss the results once they are available and plan the best course of action for your treatment.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. In the meantime, continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if you experience any worsening pain or new symptoms. We will schedule a follow-up appointment when your test results are ready. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

80,"Doctor: Hello, I am the doctor from the General Hospital of Athens. We received a transfer request for a 29-year-old female patient who experienced pulmonary embolism 24 hours after a caesarian section. Can you tell me more about her current condition?
Patient: Yeah, I'm the patient. After the caesarian section, they gave me a bolus of intravenous 5000 E Heparin. But I'm feeling very unstable now.
Doctor: I see. Let me check your vitals. Your blood pressure is 90/40 mmHg, heart rate is 140 beats/min, oxygen saturation is 85%, and breathing rate is 30 breaths/min. You are afebrile with a temperature of 37 C. We need to transfer you to our hospital immediately.
Patient: Okay, doctor.
(On the way to the hospital, the patient goes into cardiopulmonary arrest)
Doctor: Oh no, she has gone into cardiopulmonary arrest with pulseless electrical activity. We need to perform CPR immediately according to advanced life support guidelines. Let's start with manual chest compressions and artificial ventilation.
(After successful CPR)
Doctor: The CPR was effective, and now we will transfer you to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for further care.
Patient: Thank you, doctor.
(After 3 hours in the ICU)
Doctor: Your condition has continued to worsen. Your hematocrit has dropped 10 points (from 33% at ICU admission to 23% now), and you have a distended abdomen. We need to perform an emergency Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage (DPL) to check for intra-abdominal bleeding.
Patient: Alright, please do what's necessary.
(After the DPL)
Doctor: The DPL came back positive for intra-abdominal bleeding. We need to take you to the operating theatre immediately for an exploratory laparotomy.
Patient: Okay, please help me, doctor.
(During the exploratory laparotomy)
Doctor: We have found the cause of the bleeding. There is an approximately 5 cm liver laceration at the left lobe, near the attachment point of the left coronary ligament. We will perform liver suturing to control the bleeding.
Patient: Thank you, doctor.
(After the surgery)
Doctor: The surgery was successful, and the intra-abdominal bleeding has been controlled. We will continue to monitor your condition in the ICU.
(3 hours after the surgery, the patient passes away)
Doctor: (to the patient's family) I am sorry to inform you that despite our best efforts, your loved one has passed away. The cause of death was the massive pulmonary embolism that occurred after her caesarian section. Our deepest condolences to you and your family.","the surgeon discovered that the endovascular graft was not properly seated because it was positioned too high, causing compression on the inferior vena cava.

Patient: No, it's just the swelling. The other side of my neck and my upper limb are normal.
Doctor: Alright. Do you have any existing health conditions?
Patient: No, I don't have any co-morbidities.
Doctor: Let's do a physical examination. I'm going to feel the swelling on your neck first. 
(The doctor examines the patient)
Doctor: I can feel a 10 × 12 cm globular, firm, non-pulsatile, and immobile swelling. I'm going to perform a Tinel's test to check for nerve irritation. 
(The doctor performs Tinel's test)
Doctor: Tinel's sign is negative on percussion. The swelling has smooth lobulated borders and goes down to the apex of your axilla. You don't seem to have any motor or sensory deficits. However, I notice that your brachial, radial, and ulnar artery pulses are absent. There's no locoregional lymphadenopathy or metastasis. Based on my examination, I would classify this as a stage 3 tumor (T3, N0, M0) according to the TNM classification.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What do we do next?
Doctor: We'll need to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to get a better understanding of the swelling.
(After the MRI)
Doctor: The MRI shows a well-encapsulated 7.4 cm × 9.2 cm × 13.6 cm, ovoid-shaped, heterogeneous lesion in the left interscalene and posterior triangle, the costoclavicular space, and retropectoralis minor space. There are hypointense areas on T2/short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) and hyperintense with isointense areas on T1 with fluid levels. We'll need to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy to determine the nature of the swelling.
(After the biopsy)
Doctor: The biopsy results show that the swelling is a synovial sarcoma. It tested positive for TLE1, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CD56, and CD57, with weak positive S100 and SYT-SSX1 translocation in immunohistopathology.
Patient: What does that mean for me, Doctor?
Doctor: We discussed your case in a multidisciplinary team meeting with medical oncology. It was suggested that we attempt excision of the lesion, which may involve partial debulking surgery only due to the size of the tumor. After that, you will receive adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat any remaining cancer cells and prevent recurrence.
Patient: Alright, Doctor. What do I need to do to prepare for the surgery?
Doctor: We'll schedule the surgery soon. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by the surgical team. We'll closely monitor your progress and work together to give you the best possible care.

Doctor: I see. So, what brought you to the emergency room recently?
Patient: I had hematemesis and mild abdominal pain for a day, so I decided to come here.
Doctor: Alright. When you first presented at the ER, your vital signs were within normal limits, and the physical examination revealed mild periumbilical tenderness and decreased bowel sounds. There were no significant signs of peritonitis. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: We also conducted some laboratory studies. Your WBC count was at 29X10^3/μl and your hemoglobin was 4.7 g/L, which was a decline compared to your baseline hemoglobin of 9.5 g/L. Your renal and liver function tests were within normal limits, but an elevated venous lactate level was noted. Do you understand these findings?
Patient: Yes, I think so.
Doctor: We treated you with intravenous fluid resuscitation and empirical piperacillin/tazobactam. Additionally, you received 2 units of red blood cells transfusion. A computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen showed a significantly dilated colon and pneumatosis intestinalis.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: General surgery consultation deemed no surgical intervention necessary, considering that the pneumatosis intestinalis was stable compared to the previous CT findings two years ago and the absence of acute peritonitis signs. You were then admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of acute on chronic anemia from GI bleeding.
Patient: Right.
Doctor: An urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed and only identified Barrett's-type esophageal mucosa and erosive gastritis without actively bleeding lesions. You were discharged home on the 4th day of hospitalization after tolerating liquid food. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: But then you came back to the ER with severe lower abdominal pain just a few hours after discharge. Can you describe the pain?
Patient: It was a sharp, constant, and nonradiating pain in my lower abdomen.
Doctor: Did you experience melena or hematochezia?
Patient: No, I didn't.
Doctor: On examination, we noted absent bowel sounds and abdominal distention without rebound tenderness or guarding. Your laboratory evaluation was significant for leukocytosis and hypokalemia.

Doctor: Your HLA typing is A 2,- B 7, 35, Cw 4, 7, DR 4,- DQ 8,-, and you underwent a living related kidney transplant two years ago. Your donor was a 46-year-old Hispanic female with a history of hyperlipidemia and a measured 24-hour urine creatinine clearance of 151 ml/min. Her HLA typing was A 2,31, B 35,44, Cw 4,5, DR 4,-, DQ 7,8. You were on intermittent hemodialysis for two years before the transplant. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's all correct.
Doctor: Your induction therapy consisted of basiliximab and solumedrol, and your maintenance therapy has been with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. Your two-year course after the transplant has been unremarkable, with a baseline serum creatinine of 1.5–1.7 mg/dL (134–150 μmol/L), without proteinuria or hematuria. Is that right?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Have you experienced any flu-like illness recently?
Patient: Yes, I had a flu-like illness about a week ago.
Doctor: I understand you've admitted to inadvertently taking tacrolimus 1 mg q12h instead of your prescribed dose of 3 mg twice a day for almost a month, but corrected the dose approximately 3 weeks prior to the presentation. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's what happened.
Doctor: During the examination, I found that you're normotensive and afebrile. Your cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were normal. You have periorbital edema and 6 mm pitting edema in your lower extremities. There was no graft tenderness or bruit. Is there anything else you'd like to share with me?
Patient: No, that's everything.
Doctor: Your recent laboratory data showed a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL (194 μmol/L). Your urinalysis showed moderate blood and 3+ protein (previously no proteinuria), with urinary sediment of more than 50 red blood cells (RBCs) and 11–20 white blood cells (WBCs) per high power field. This might be related to your recent flu-like illness and the change in your tacrolimus dosage.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We will need to closely monitor your condition and adjust your medications as needed. Please make sure to follow your prescribed dosages, and let us know if you experience any further symptoms or changes in your condition.
Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and feel free to reach out if you have any concerns or questions.",
84,"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been dealing with left lower extremity pain for over 10 years. It has worsened significantly over the past two years, so I thought it's time to seek further medical attention.
Doctor: I see. Can you describe the pain for me?
Patient: It's like a throbbing and cramping sensation, and it doesn't go away even after I rest.
Doctor: Alright, let's go over your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
Patient: Yes, I have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and I use tobacco every day.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Were you leading an active lifestyle before the onset of the lower extremity pain?
Patient: Yes, I was healthy and active before all this started.
Doctor: Let's perform a physical exam. *Examines patient* Your feet are warm and pink with normal sensation and 2+ distal pulses. We'll need to do an arterial Doppler of your left lower extremity to investigate further.
*After the Doppler test*
Doctor: The Doppler revealed severe stenosis of your left superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery. We started you on cilostazol 100 milligrams two times per day, but your symptoms did not improve. We then performed an arteriography.
Patient: What did the arteriography show?
Doctor: The arteriography showed normal iliac, common femoral, and superficial femoral arteries without atherosclerosis. However, there was occlusion of your left popliteal artery and extensive collateral flow to your leg. This raised suspicion for PAES.
Patient: What did you do next?
Doctor: We performed a study with provocative maneuvers. Dorsiflexion and plantar extension of your ankle caused the cessation of the collateral and distal popliteal artery flow. When your ankle was returned to a neutral position, the occlusion ceased and flow was restored. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of PAES with resulting popliteal artery occlusion.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We performed a popliteal artery bypass with a reverse great saphenous vein. I'm happy to report that the procedure was successful and your symptoms have resolved.
Patient: That's great to hear! I'm so relieved.
Doctor: I'm glad we could help. It's important to monitor your condition and follow up with us regularly. Also, I'd strongly recommend quitting tobacco use as it can contribute to your medical conditions.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll definitely consider quitting and will follow up as needed.","ty pain for more than ten years with worsening symptoms since two years. they report having used tobacco and a high intake of alcohol. their past medical history includes being a smoker, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and frequent smoking. the patient states that they lead a relatively sedentary life with moderate exercise participation. upon physical examination, the patient reports warm, pinkish-purple skin and normal peripheral digital pulsations at both legs. however, the patient experiences significant limb ischemia"
85,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 77-year-old male patient with a history of myocardial infarction for half a year. Have you experienced any significant discomfort during this time?
Patient: No, not really. I've been living a normal life at home without any major issues.
Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me what happened two hours before you were admitted to the hospital?
Patient: I suddenly developed significant palpitations and shortness of breath. It was really scary.
Doctor: I see. You were then admitted to the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University by ambulance. When we examined you, your expression was painful, and we heard a distinct murmur in the precordium. We also performed an Electrocardiogram, which showed old left ventricular anteroseptal myocardial infarction. An X-ray confirmed an enlarged heart shadow. However, your myocardial enzymes and other laboratory test results showed no significant abnormalities. 
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Echocardiography revealed that the interventricular septum was thinned near the apex and bulged toward the right ventricular side, with a rupture opening of about 8 mm in diameter visible on its top (Fig.). CDFI showed that left ventricular blood shunted to the right ventricle through the rupture (Fig.), with a shunt velocity measured by CW of about 410 cm/s, and a PG of 67 mmHg.
Patient: Hmm, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is. The echocardiography also showed left ventricular enlargement with an anteroposterior diameter of about 61 mm, significantly reduced wall motion amplitude, a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of about 33%, moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of about 60 mmHg. The echocardiographic diagnosis is old myocardial infarction of ventricular septal apex with ventricular septal rupture.
Patient: So, what can be done about it, doc?
Doctor: Due to your older age and reduced left ventricular function, surgical repair of the site of ventricular septal rupture would be very difficult. After multidisciplinary discussion, it was agreed that you couldn't undergo thoracotomy and were not suitable for thoracotomy. Instead, echocardiography guided interventional occlusion of the ruptured interventricular septum could be performed.
Patient: I see. So, what's next?
Doctor: We will need your family's consent for the interventional occlusion procedure. Once they have signed a written consent, we can proceed with the treatment.
Patient: Okay, I'll talk to my family about it.
(After obtaining the family's consent)
Doctor: Great, we've received the consent. Under the guidance of transesophageal echocardiography, we will clearly display the ventricular septal rupture during the surgery. We will measure the size of the rupture again to ensure the proper occluder device is used to prevent it from falling off.
Patient: I understand. Thank you, doctor. I hope the procedure goes well.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to provide you with the best possible care and treatment.",", we will work to improve"
86,"Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our hospital due to leukocytosis. How have you been feeling lately?
Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling okay. I don't have any noticeable symptoms.
Doctor: Alright, let's go over your blood examination results. You have eosinophilia with a WBC count of 15.7 × 109/L, which includes 28% neutrophils, 55% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 3% monocytes, and 13% lymphocytes. Your hemoglobin is 13.0 g/dl, and your platelet count is 339 × 109/L. Your LDH levels are a bit high at 232 U/L, with the normal range being 100-220 U/L. However, your liver and renal functions are normal.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Since we haven't identified any clinical symptoms or organ damage, I suggest a regular monthly follow-up for now. Let's see how your condition progresses.
Patient: Okay, that sounds reasonable.
(After 4 months)
Patient: Doctor, I've developed some respiratory symptoms like cough and dyspnea over the past few months.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll need to do a chest X-ray and a computed tomography (CT) scan to investigate further. 
(After the tests)
Doctor: Your chest X-ray and CT scanning results show bilateral lung infiltrates. We also performed a bronchoscopy and obtained bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which revealed an increased probability of eosinophils - 20.5% eosinophils, 78.0% macrophages, 1.0% lymphocytes, and 0.5% neutrophils.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Based on these findings, you've been diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia. We'll begin treatment with prednisone at a dose of 0.5 mg kg−1 day−1.
Patient: Will this treatment help with my symptoms?
Doctor: Yes, the treatment with prednisone should improve the shadow of infiltrates on the X-ray and your respiratory symptoms. However, it may not reduce the increased number of eosinophils in circulation. Therefore, we'll carry out a bone marrow examination as well.
(After the bone marrow examination)
Doctor: The bone marrow examination showed normocellularity with elevated eosinophils at 22.1% of nuclear cells, without blastoid cell proliferation (0%). Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow revealed 46, XY, t(2;5)(q37;q31) [16/20]/46, XY [4/20]. FISH analysis in the peripheral blood leukocytes showed the presence of a split signal at PDGFRB. Additionally, WT1 mRNA was positively expressed at 1,200 copies/μg RNA in the peripheral blood.
Patient: What do these results mean for me?
Doctor: The detection of PDGFRB rearrangement means that you're a candidate for a targeted therapy called imatinib. This medication will be added to your treatment plan to help manage your condition.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.",
87,"Doctor: Hello, I see in your report that you're a 70-year-old male patient who has presented with the chief complaint of dribbling watery secretions from your nasal mucosa when you think of or see food. Can you tell me more about this?
Patient: Yes, doctor. Every time it happens, about 50-100 ml of watery fluid comes out of my nose.
Doctor: I also see in your history that you've had hypertension for three years and type 2 diabetes mellitus for five years. Is there any history of neuro-degenerative disease in your family?
Patient: No, doctor. There's no such history in my family.
Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, such as constipation or mucus in your stool?
Patient: Hmm, yes. I've had constipation for about three months and I've noticed mucus in my stool.
Doctor: I understand that you've had a colonoscopy performed, which didn't reveal any significant pathology. Have you experienced any dementia or psychiatric disturbances?
Patient: No, I haven't had any issues like that.
Doctor: What about sleep abnormalities, forward flex posture, or a broad-based gait? Have you noticed any of these symptoms?
Patient: I do have some mild sleep abnormalities, and I've noticed a forward flex posture and a broad-based gait.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, I made a provisional diagnosis of gustatory rhinorrhea and advised you to take anti-cholinergic medications and anti-histamine drugs. Did you see any improvements with these medications?
Patient: Not really, doctor. There was little to no benefit from those medications.
Doctor: I also prescribed nasal corticosteroid sprays, mucolytic medications, and nasal irrigations. Did these prescriptions provide any symptomatic improvement?
Patient: They helped a little bit, but the improvement was only mild.
Doctor: I see that twenty-two months later, you presented again and had developed fine tremors in your fingers and hands. Were these tremors absent in your head and lower limbs?
Patient: Yes, doctor. The tremors were only in my fingers and hands.
Doctor: Were the tremors evident at rest or only during activity?
Patient: The tremors were only evident at rest, not during activity.
Doctor: Upon further examination, we noticed an altered sense of smell, which you hadn't noticed before. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. We started you on dopamine-based therapy, which should help improve both your rhinorrhea and motor symptoms. Have you noticed any improvements since starting this therapy?
Patient: Yes, doctor. I've definitely seen an improvement in both my rhinorrhea and motor symptoms since starting the dopamine-based therapy.
Doctor: That's great to hear. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as necessary. If you have any concerns or notice any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to reach out.",
88,"Doctor: Hi there, I recently received a referral from your primary care physician regarding concerns about polycythemia. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any unusual symptoms lately?
Patient: Hmm, not really. I've been feeling okay.
Doctor: I see. I understand you've recently started full masculinizing hormone therapy with transdermal testosterone gel, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Your laboratory report showed that your hemoglobin is 168 g/L and hematocrit is 0.49, which are flagged as high based on female reference ranges. However, since you're on hormone therapy, we should actually be using the male reference ranges. For males, the hemoglobin reference range is 120-170g/L and hematocrit is 0.36-0.50.
Patient: Oh, okay. So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: Androgens, like the testosterone you're taking, are known to stimulate erythropoiesis, which can result in an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count. On the other hand, the impact of estrogens isn't as well understood. In trans individuals on feminizing hormone therapy with estradiol and anti-androgen, there's usually a significant decrease in hemoglobin and other blood parameters.
Patient: I see. So, is this something I should be worried about?
Doctor: It's worth noting that some studies suggest a higher hematocrit is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. This is probably more of a consideration for people using masculinizing hormone therapy like you. However, since you've just started the therapy, your serum hematocrit levels might still be adjusting. It's evident that serum hematocrit levels in the affirmed gender's range can be seen from 3 months after commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy.
Patient: Alright. Is there anything else I should be doing?
Doctor: As smoking can also increase hematocrit levels, I would recommend smoking cessation if you're a smoker. This will help in maintaining healthy hematocrit levels and reduce any potential risks.
Patient: Got it. I don't smoke, but that's good to know.
Doctor: That's great to hear. For now, we'll continue monitoring your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels using the male reference ranges since you're on masculinizing hormone therapy. If there are any concerns regarding your levels in the future, we will address them accordingly.
Patient: Alright, thank you for the explanation.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!",
89,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been admitted due to unilateral proptosis in your left eye that has been developing for about six months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've had this bulging in my left eye for a while now. It's been quite uncomfortable.
Doctor: I understand. Your medical history shows that you have suffered from HT for the past 2 years and have been treated with levothyroxine 25 μg daily. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: You also mentioned that you don't have any other significant comorbidities, have never smoked, and your personal and family history is negative for thyroid disorders. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: We've run some tests, and your laboratory results indicate euthyroidism. Your TSH level is 2.67 μU/ml, which is within the reference range of 0.27–4.20 μU/ml. Your free T3 and free T4 concentrations are also within the normal ranges, at 4.97 pmol/l and 13.58 pmol/l, respectively.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Your thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) concentration is normal as well at 0.9 IU/l. However, your anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) serum levels and anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) are significantly elevated, at 279 IU/ml and 194 IU/ml, respectively.
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: It suggests that there may be an autoimmune issue. Additionally, your 25-OH vitamin D serum level is 25 ng/ml, which indicates mild vitamin D deficiency.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also performed an ultrasound examination, which demonstrated features suggesting chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Your thyroid gland showed heterogeneous decreased echogenicity, no focal lesions, and normal size and vascularity.
Patient: So what's causing the problem with my eye?
Doctor: In the neutral position, your left eyeball is positioned convergently and downwards, which implies extraocular muscle involvement. You also presented with conjunctival erythema, eyelid redness and edema, and an enlarged, swollen lacrimal caruncle. Von Graefe's, Stellwag's, Kocher's, and Moebius' signs were positive in your left eye, whereas the Rosenbach's sign was negative.
Patient: Oh, I didn't realize all those signs were connected.
Doctor: Yes, these signs and symptoms, along with your lab results, suggest that your eye condition may be related to your thyroid issue. We will continue to monitor your progress and discuss the best course of treatment for both your eye and thyroid.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.

90,"Doctor: Hello, please tell me about the incident that brought you here today.
Patient: Well, I'm a 40-year-old construction worker, and about a week ago, I slipped and fell from a height of 3 meters. I got a deep penetrating wound on the right side of my neck when I fell on a sharp piece of iron rod.
Doctor: That sounds very painful. How did you manage the injury at the scene?
Patient: I quickly pulled the iron rod out when I got up from the floor. The bleeding wasn't too bad, and it stopped by the time I got to the local hospital.
Doctor: I see. Did you experience any hemiplegia, paraplegia, or quadriplegia after the accident?
Patient: No, I didn't have any of those issues.
Doctor: Good. Are you known to be hypertensive, and did you consume any alcohol prior to the fall?
Patient: No, I'm not hypertensive, and I didn't have any alcohol before the fall. I do drink occasionally, though.
Doctor: Noted. Have you had any previous accidents or injuries?
Patient: Yes, I had a left femoral fracture at the age of 24 and a right femoral fracture at the age of 32. Both were treated successfully with surgery.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Now, let me examine you. [After examination] You appear to be conscious, alert, and acutely ill with your neck in a cervical collar. Your general and neurological examinations are normal, including your pupils' reaction to light and cranial nerves. Your limb strength and reflexes are also normal. Your digital rectal examination shows a normal spinster tone. Additionally, your ECG, CXR, and other routine lab tests are normal.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: However, the neck CT-scan done at the local hospital revealed fractures on the right side of your C2-C4 transverse processes, a fracture at the right lamina of C3, and a dissection of your right common carotid artery. The CT-scan of your head showed no abnormalities.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed a three-dimensional reconstruction plain and enhanced scan imaging of your cervical spine, chest, and abdomen. It revealed two segmental stenoses of your right common carotid artery.
Patient: What does that mean for me, doc?
Doctor: It means that we need to closely monitor your condition and plan the appropriate treatment for your fractures and artery dissection. We'll discuss your options with you and ensure that you receive the best possible care.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.",

Patient: No, I don't have any prior psychiatric history.
Doctor: Okay. I was informed that emergency medical services brought you in at the request of your mother due to your increased aggression and paranoia at home. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, it started a couple of months ago when I left home to stay with my boyfriend. I felt like people were trying to kill me, and I even attacked my mom when she was driving. I also started accusing my family members of being replacements, like in Capgras syndrome.
Doctor: That must have been distressing for you and your family. Your mother also mentioned that you've been intrusive towards strangers on the street, reading the Bible, and getting in people's faces. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's true. I've been doing that.
Doctor: When you were presented to the hospital, you seemed very confused, internally preoccupied, disorganized, and providing delayed and inappropriate responses to questions. Was this your first psychiatric presentation?
Patient: Yes, it was my first time.
Doctor: I also noticed that you have an elongated face with small ears rotated backward and exhibit hypernasal speech. Additionally, you appeared to be labile, crying for no apparent reason and then later singing out loud. Can you tell me more about these behaviors?
Patient: I don't know, it's just how I've been acting lately. I can't really explain it.
Doctor: I see. The patient refused to come out of her room for an initial interview. During the interview, you remained evasive and guarded. Your thought process seemed illogical, and your thought content was delusional. For example, you thought your mother was the devil. Can you tell me more about these thoughts?
Patient: It's hard to explain, but I just feel like she's not who she says she is. I also hear Jesus's voice telling me everything's going to be okay.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. You mentioned hearing Jesus's voice, but you denied experiencing visual, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations. Have you had any thoughts of suicide or homicide?
Patient: No, I haven't had any suicidal or homicidal thoughts.
Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. Lastly, you admitted to using illicit drugs in the past, such as marijuana, Ecstasy, Molly, and alcohol. Can you tell me more about your drug use?
Patient: Yeah, I've tried those drugs before, but I can't remember the last time I used them.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. We will continue to monitor your condition and work on a treatment plan to help you manage these symptoms. It's important to be honest about your experiences so we can provide the best possible care for you.",tion and treatment. I hope this helps clarify things for both you and your family.

Patient: Hi, doc. I've been experiencing abdominal pain and frequent episodes of watery diarrhea for the past 2 months.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Yeah, I had a gastric ulcer about 40 years ago, and I also have hypertension and have undergone chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm taking aspirin, prednisolone, melphalan, and lansoprazole.
Doctor: Okay, let's check your temperature. It's within the normal range. Now, let me do a physical examination. Hmm, I notice acute left abdominal pain and muscular defense. We'll need to run some tests.
[After running laboratory tests]
Doctor: Your laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2100/μl, which is below the normal range of 3000–8000/μl. Your C-reactive protein (CRP) level is 0.19 mg/dl, which is within the normal range of less than 0.30 mg/dl. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan.
Patient: What did the CT scan show?
Doctor: The CT scan showed a thickened bowel wall with edema involving free air around the colonic splenic flexure, and ascites on the liver surface (Fig. a, b). Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with peritonitis and colonic perforation.
Patient: Oh no, what do we do now?
Doctor: We will need to perform an emergency laparotomy. During the procedure, we found that the ascites contained intestinal fluid. The colon around the splenic angle was necrotic and edematous, so we performed a left hemicolectomy.
Patient: What were the findings after the surgery?
Doctor: Macroscopic findings showed edematous mucosa and tortuous longitudinal ulcers. Histopathological examination revealed typical findings of collagenous colitis, with a thick subepithelial collagenous band and deep ulcers with perforation. Active lymphocyte infiltration was observed in all layers of the colon. Fortunately, there was no evidence of acute ischemic colitis or inflammatory bowel disease.
Patient: So, what happens now?
Doctor: Your postoperative course was uneventful, and you were discharged on the 28th postoperative day. We suspect that your condition may be related to the lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), that you have been taking. We will change your PPI from lansoprazole to rabeprazole.
Patient: Will that help with my symptoms?
Doctor: Yes, after changing the PPI, you should notice an improvement in your diarrhea symptoms.

93,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you have been admitted to the emergency service. Can you please tell me about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having hiccups and fever for the past six weeks. The hiccups usually happen when there's some lead stimulation.
Doctor: I see. I understand you have a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and had a dual chamber pacemaker and implantable cardioverter defibrillator implanted due to atrioventricular complete block three months ago, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I had a coronary angiography before the procedure, and they said my arteries were normal.
Doctor: Okay, and I also see that you were given antibiotic therapy for a fever six weeks after the implantation. You have a history of diabetes and hypertension for 10 years, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's accurate.
Doctor: When you were admitted, your fever was at 39.5°C, blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg, and heart rate at 100/min. We also noted rough pulmonary sounds, but no crepitation, and a 2/6 pansystolic murmur at all cardiac foci. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs?
Patient: Yeah, there's been some mild edema in both of my legs.
Doctor: We also observed splinter hemorrhages in your nails. Your electrocardiogram showed pacemaker rhythms and a bigeminy ventricular extrasystole. A chest x-ray revealed a bilateral reticulonodular pattern, bilateral pleural effusions, and an increased cardiothoracic index. The pacemaker generator implanted in your left pectoral region was present along with two leads, which appeared to extend into the heart. 
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Your lab tests showed a WBC of 12,300/m3, sedimentation of 62mm, and CRP of 235 mg/L. Your HbA1C level was 6.2%. With these clinical manifestations, you were hospitalized with the diagnosis of unknown fever and hiccups in the department of infectious diseases. You were started on drug therapy with sulbactam, ampicillin, and ciprofloxacin. 
Patient: Okay, and how did that go?
Doctor: Your blood culture yielded a positive result for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus. Your body temperature decreased for a while, but it increased again to 39°C on day nine. Consequently, you were designated to undergo a transthoracic echocardiography. Unfortunately, your hiccups have continued throughout this period.
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what's the next step in my treatment?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your medications as needed. We'll also perform regular tests to track your progress. It's essential to keep a close eye on your symptoms and report any changes to your medical team.

Patient: I'm feeling okay, thank you.
Doctor: I see that you experienced an ST-elevation myocardial infarction 2 years ago and had a successful treatment with 3 drug-eluting stents in your left anterior descending artery. Can you tell me if you've had any recent symptoms or discomfort?
Patient: No, I haven't had any symptoms lately.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Your echocardiography results show a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. However, there are regional wall motion abnormalities corresponding to the territory of the infarction, which are anterior and anteroseptal. Do you understand what that means?
Patient: Oh, not really.
Doctor: It means that although your heart is functioning well overall, there are still some areas of the heart muscle that are not moving as they should due to the previous heart attack.
Patient: I see, so what can we do about it?
Doctor: Your cardiovascular risk profile shows a history of smoking, with 20 pack-years, treated hypercholesteremia, obesity with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2, and psychosocial stress. It is important to address these risk factors to prevent further complications.
Patient: Yes, I've been trying to work on those.
Doctor: That's great. Your current medication includes aspirin, bisoprolol, lisinopril, and rosuvastatin. Please continue taking these medications as prescribed.
Patient: Okay, I will.
Doctor: Even though you are currently free of symptoms, in light of secondary preventive aims, I recommend you undergo cardiovascular rehabilitation to further improve your heart health and reduce the risk of future events.
Patient: What does cardiovascular rehabilitation involve?
Doctor: It typically involves a combination of exercise training, education on heart-healthy living, and counseling to reduce stress and help you return to an active life.
Patient: That sounds helpful. How do I get started?
Doctor: I will refer you to a specialist who will provide a tailored program for your specific needs and guide you through the process.

Patient: Yes, I went to my obstetrician who prescribed me analgesics and hormonal therapy, like oral contraceptives and gonatropin-releasing hormone agonist, but they didn't really help with the pain.
Doctor: I understand. Let's run some tests to see what might be causing the pain. We can start with an ultrasound and a CT scan to get a better look at the area.

Doctor: The results from the ultrasound and CT scan confirm the presence of a mid-rectus lesion, which indicates endometriosis.
Patient: Oh no, what do we do now?
Doctor: We will perform an excision of the mass to remove the lesion and then reinforce the area with mesh. This should help alleviate the pain you've been experiencing.
Patient: Okay, I hope that works. What do the pathology results say?
Doctor: The pathology results confirm the presence of endometrial stroma, which is consistent with endometriosis.
Patient: So, after the surgery, will I be disease-free?
Doctor: Yes, after the excision and mesh reinforcement, you should be disease-free. However, we will need to see you regularly for check-ups, at least for the first two months after surgery.
Patient: Alright, I'll make sure to follow up with you. Thank you, doctor.","Patient: hi, ive been having recurrent cyclic pain in the left side of my abdomen near the linea alba scar from a previous caesarian section. it seems to affect mainly the levator ani muscles. Doctor: im sorry to hear that. how has your treatment been so far? patient: well, my current healthcare provider did a sonography and a ct scan, both showed a middle rectosigmoid mass, but there wasnt enough information about its location.
doctor: i see. lets discuss our options. based on the findings from the ct scans, theres evidence of endometriosis. however, the primary lesions were found outside of the rectum, suggesting different areas of involvement. additionally, the examination revealed that the mass cant be identified due to the high density of fat within the tumor, making identification difficult. 
patient: oh, okay. so, what does that mean for my future care?
doctor: because the mass cant be clearly localized, we plan to proceed with surgical intervention. during the postoperative period, we will monitor your condition closely using imaging techniques such as mri and computed tomographic angiography cta to ensure proper healing. 
patient: thats good to know. how long are you planning to keep monitoring me?
doctor: we will continue to observe your progress"
96,"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been admitted to our Department of Dermatology due to swelling and pain in your right hand. Can you tell me more about what happened?
Patient: Yeah, I injured my hand at work about 10 days ago. I got cut with a calk and had a 5-mm long wound over my third MCP joint. It was red and swollen.
Doctor: I see. It looks like you were examined by a dermatologist, who applied a simple wound dressing and discharged you with a prescription for regular oral antibiotics. How has the wound been since then?
Patient: Well, a week later, the swelling and redness got worse, and there was pus-like discharge. That's when I came back to the hospital.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. We took Radiographs of your hand and found a visible tooth mark at the third metacarpal head. Your body temperature was also 38.5 °C, and laboratory tests showed an increased number of white blood cells (12.00 × 109/L) and elevated C-reactive protein (25.00 mg/L). Based on these findings, we suspected osteomyelitis of the right third metacarpal head due to a clenched-fist injury.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it can be. We quickly performed wound exploration in the operation room and found a partial lesion of the extensor and the second metacarpal head due to the bite and infection. An intraoperative Gram-stain wound culture was also done, but it didn't reveal any bacteria, likely because of the initial antibiotic treatment you received.
Patient: So, what did you do next?
Doctor: We performed surgical debridement three times and gave you intravenous systematic antibiotic therapy to completely resolve the osteomyelitis. However, the repeated debridements left a large defect in your third extensor and third metacarpal head, which measured 18 × 15 mm.
Patient: That's why my finger is so painful and I can't move it, right?
Doctor: Yes, exactly. Your motion arc is 0°, the pinch strength of the injured finger is 1.0 kg, and your DASH score is 52. To treat this, we decided to use an osteochondral vascularised medial femoral trochlea (MFT) flap for the third metacarpal head defect.
Patient: How did you get the flap?
Doctor: We harvested the flap using the method described by Bürger et al. This procedure should help you regain function in your finger.
Patient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything. What should I expect during my recovery?
Doctor: You'll likely need some time for the flap to fully integrate, and you may experience some pain and stiffness in your finger. We'll closely monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care to ensure a smooth recovery.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","against performing a follow-up clinical examination until your health status is stable. In summary, the patient suffered from painful swelling and redness in his right hand, followed by a complete loss of flexibility in the affected finger. Fortunately, the wound did not progress beyond an enlargement of 16 × 11 cm, indicating that there were no deep abscesses"
97,"Doctor: Good morning, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling pain in my right knee while running for more than 3 months now. It's especially painful on the lateral side.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any restrictions in your movement or any other symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've noticed that my knee extension is limited. It's restricted to about 10 degrees.
Doctor: Okay, let's perform a physical examination to understand the issue better. I'm going to perform the McMurray test. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.
Patient: Hmm, I feel some discomfort during the test.
Doctor: It seems that the McMurray test is positive, but there's no instability. We will need to conduct some imaging tests to get more information. Let's start with an X-ray.
Patient: Alright, doctor.
(After the X-ray)
Doctor: The X-ray findings show no remarkable issues. However, to get a clearer picture, let's do an MRI.
Patient: Okay, sure.
(After the MRI)
Doctor: The MRI results show that the DLM has a horizontal high signal cleavage. Based on this, I recommend that you undergo surgery followed by postoperative therapy, similar to a previous case I've handled.
Patient: I understand, doctor. I'm willing to go through with the surgery and therapy.
(After two years)
Doctor: How have you been feeling since the surgery?
Patient: I've been great, doctor! I have no symptoms while running, and my range of motion is back to normal.
Doctor: That's excellent to hear. I just reviewed your recent X-ray, and it shows a slight narrowing of the lateral joint space. The MRI also shows a thin lateral meniscus that has maintained its width at 12.1 mm with no progression of coronal or sagittal extrusion.
Patient: That's a relief. Thank you so much, doctor, for all your help!
Doctor: You're welcome! Just remember to continue with any recommended exercises and follow-ups to maintain your knee health. If you have any concerns in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.","following ACL reconstruction, which may be related to chronic knee pain. The study found that patients who experienced hip subluxations were significantly younger (mean age: 47 vs. Mean age: 69), had lower levels of education, and reported more significant chronic knee pain compared to those without hip subluxations. Furthermore, these individuals had higher prevalence rates of comorbidities such as arthritis, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and anxiety. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that hip subluxation after ACL reconstruction may occur due to chronic knee pain, which highlights the importance of addressing underlying conditions prior to reconstructive surgery."
98,"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to our hospital with a 3-day history of acute abdominal pain. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been experiencing some really bad pain in my stomach for the past few days. 
Doctor: I understand. Our physical examination revealed right upper quadrant pain and normal bowel sounds. We also found Murphy's sign to be positive. However, your vital signs are within the normal range. We performed an abdominal ultrasonography, which showed an enlarged gallbladder with surrounding tissue inflammation. 
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. 
Doctor: We also checked your blood biochemistry, which was essentially normal. Your C-reactive protein level was 1.9 mg/dL, and total bilirubin level was 1.4 mg/dL. An enhanced computed tomography examination revealed an incarcerated gallstone and an enlarged gallbladder. 
Patient: Hmm, so what does that mean for me?
Doctor: We performed a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which demonstrated the root of the cystic duct. The middle portion of the cystic duct was unclear, though. With the preoperative diagnosis of grade II acute gangrenous cholecystitis, we planned a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) to remove your gallbladder.
Patient: Alright, tell me more about the surgery.
Doctor: We inserted the first port into your umbilicus and observed an enlarged and reddish gallbladder. It was swollen, but we did not detect torsion intraoperatively. The second port was placed in the epigastric area, while others were at the right hypochondriac and right lumbar regions. Your gallbladder was attached to the left side of the hepatic round ligament. 
Patient: So how did it go?
Doctor: Severe inflammation and the narrow working space between the epigastric port and the gallbladder made it difficult to dissect Calot's triangle. However, we were able to resect the cystic duct and the cystic artery after confirming the critical view of safety. Due to the severe inflammation, we performed a subtotal cholecystectomy. The operation took 178 minutes, and there was some intraoperative blood loss.
Patient: I see. What's next for me?
Doctor: Now that the surgery is complete, we will closely monitor your recovery and provide any necessary post-operative care. It's important to follow the instructions we give you to ensure proper healing and prevent complications. We'll also schedule follow-up appointments to check your progress.
Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor.","ximately 25 mm x 17 mm near the cystic duct wall. Based on these findings, we concluded that the lesions could potentially represent a liver tumor.
Patient: Is there anything else we need to know?
Doctor: Yes, based on imaging findings, we believe the lesions may be associated with a multifocal mural nodule in the same region. To address this issue, we decided to perform a partial resection of the affected areas and transplant the remaining healthy liver via the esophagus.

99,"Doctor: Hello, can you tell me how your 11-month-old daughter has been feeling after her open pyeloplasty surgery for the pelvic ureteric junction obstruction?
Patient's parent: Hi doctor, she has been having a low-grade fever and has been quite irritable since the first postoperative day.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit about her medical history?
Patient's parent: Sure, her birth and developmental history have been normal, but she did have two episodes of pyelonephritis and a right pyeloureteral stenosis, which led to the pyeloplasty surgery. She's been on fosfomycin antibiotic prophylaxis for the last few months.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Did she receive any antibiotics during the surgery?
Patient's parent: Yes, she was given a single dose of amoxiclavulanate intravenously.
Doctor: Alright. When I examined her during the first 12 hours after the surgery, she was a febrile irritable infant with a pulse of 120 and normal blood pressure. Her neutrophil count was elevated at 19.8 × 10^9/L and her C-reactive protein was also high at 9.1 U/L. Additionally, her hemoglobin decreased from 11.5 to 8.3 mg/dL post-surgery. 
Patient's parent: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Yes, we needed to take action to address these issues. Her surgical wound appeared slightly erythematous at the time, so we started her on cefotaxime therapy at 150 mg/kg/day e.v. and ordered an erythrocyte transfusion.
Patient's parent: I see. How did she respond to the treatment?
Doctor: Unfortunately, the local examination the next day revealed a dark bluish erythema of the entire surgical wound measuring 9 × 6 cm, and a satellite lesion 5 cm away. These lesions were tender and warm upon palpation. It seems that a ring retractor used during surgery to enhance the surgical field view might have caused the satellite lesion.
Patient's parent: Oh no, that's not good.
Doctor: Yes, we also noticed that her entire right flank appeared erythematous and warm. Her C-reactive protein and leukocyte count increased to 23.5 × 10^9/L and 23.4 U/L, respectively. She was still febrile and tachycardic, but thankfully did not require further homodynamic or ventilatory support.
Patient's parent: So, what's the diagnosis, doctor?
Doctor: We have determined that she has a necrotizing soft-tissue infection (NSTI) with sepsis. We've started her on meropenem at 60 mg/kg/day e.v. to help treat the infection.
Patient's parent: I hope that helps her. Thank you for all your efforts, doctor.","condition conservatively until she reaches admission to a hospital. However, if she develops signs of acute kidney injury such as increased creatinine levels above 74 moll, hypovolemic shock, or persistent hypertension despite adequate fluid resuscitation, then further management may be required.
