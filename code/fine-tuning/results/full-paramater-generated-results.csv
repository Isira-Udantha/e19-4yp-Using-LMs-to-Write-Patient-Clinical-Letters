"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Hi, I don't have any past medical history.
Doctor: Okay. What brings you in today?
Patient: I've been experiencing painless blurry vision in my right eye for a week now. I've also had intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on my lower legs for the past 6 months.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynaud's phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity?
Patient: No, only an isolated episode of left knee swelling and testicular swelling in the past.
Doctor: Do you work with any toxic substances or have any habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use?
Patient: No, I work as a flooring installer and I don't have any toxic habits.
Doctor: Alright. We checked your vital signs and they were normal. During the physical exam, we found bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in your right eye, which was greater than in your left eye. You also have a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. Your muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and your sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. We also noticed the maculopapular rash on your bilateral lower extremities.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. You have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gm/dL, hematocrit of 35.3%, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fL. You also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmol/L. Your erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 33 mm/hr, and your C-reactive protein (CRP) is also elevated at 13.3 mg/L. Your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.
Patient: Okay. What does that mean?
Doctor: These results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. We also performed a lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. We'll run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition. In the meantime, we'll monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. We'll keep you informed about any new findings and discuss the best course of treatment.
Patient: Alright, thank you, Doctor.","S: The patient reports experiencing painless blurry vision in the right eye for a week, intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on the lower legs for the past 6 months.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you're a 7-year-old boy with congenital bilateral sensorineural deafness, and you've had a failed right cochlear implant. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, doctor.
Doctor: We recently conducted a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) before transferring you to the operating theatre for an ABI insertion. During the MRI, your airway was secured with a size 5.5 mm internal-diameter uncuffed ETT. Did you experience any discomfort during the MRI?
Patient: No, it was okay.
Doctor: Great. Now, during the surgery, we will be performing intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring, which includes brainstem auditory sensory evoked potentials, brainstem mapping of CN IX, X, XI, XII and their motor nuclei, and corticobulbar tract motor-evoked potential (MEP). This will help us monitor your nerves during the procedure.
Patient: Okay, doctor.
Doctor: Our anesthesia team will be responsible for the lead placement for CN IX, X, XI, XII. We will use a 32 mm by 29 mm laryngeal electrode for CN X monitoring (Fig.). To ensure optimal electrode placement on the tracheal tube, we positioned you as intended for surgery (right lateral) and identified the depth of ETT corresponding to the laryngeal inlet using a C-MAC Laryngoscope.
Patient: Hmm, alright.
Doctor: This corresponded to 6 cm at vocal cords (15 cm at lips). We then prepared a new #5.5 uncuffed ETT with the laryngeal electrodes (Fig.) and re-intubated you, in keeping with the measurements. 
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: For CN IX placement, we put a pin electrode on the ipsilateral soft palate. For CN XII, we placed electrodes on the anterior tongue. 
Patient: I see.
Doctor: To stabilize the tracheal tube, we used rolled up gauzes on either side of it (Fig.), which also acted as a bite block.
Patient: Alright, doctor.
Doctor: During the surgery, we will administer Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) which includes propofol (Paedsfusor Target Control Infusion, target plasma concentration 3.5–5.0 mcg/ml) and remifentanil (0.08–0.3 mcg/kg/min).
Patient: Will I feel any pain during the surgery?
Doctor: No, the anesthesia will ensure that you remain comfortable and pain-free throughout the procedure.
Patient: That's good to know.
Doctor: After the surgery, we will closely monitor your recovery and provide any necessary follow-up care. It's important that you follow our instructions to ensure the best possible outcome.
Patient: Yes, doctor. I will.
Doctor: Great. If you or your family have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help.","S: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with congenital bilateral sensorineural deafness, with a failed right cochlear implant.

"Doctor: Hello, we've received your results from the ultrasound we performed in April 2017. It seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. We also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.
Patient: Hmm, what did the screening results show, doctor?
Doctor: Your calcitonin level was found to be slightly elevated at 40 ng/mL, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ng/mL. To further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.
Patient: And what did the stimulation test show?
Doctor: After the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ng/mL, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. As a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.
Patient: Yes, I remember that. How was my recovery after the surgery?
Doctor: Your postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. However, it completely recovered 48 hours after the surgery, and you were discharged.
Patient: That's good to hear. What did the tests on the removed tissue show?
Doctor: Immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) measuring 1 cm. It is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. A histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, but negative for the presence of amyloid.
Patient: What about the other surrounding tissue?
Doctor: Focal foci of C-cells hyperplasia were spread throughout the entire gland. However, none of the lymph nodes in the central compartment showed any signs of metastases.
Patient: That's a relief. What other tests were done on the tissue?
Doctor: To perform a more detailed analysis, we treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with antigen retrieval using citrate buffer at high pH. They were then immunolabeled with a rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin antibody and incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.
Patient: So, what does this all mean for my condition?
Doctor: Overall, these results confirm the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Fortunately, none of the lymph nodes showed signs of metastases, which is a positive sign. It's important to continue with regular follow-up appointments and monitoring to ensure proper management of your condition.","S: The patient reports a single thyroid nodule in the left lobe measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter and a complete biochemical screening for TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.

"Doctor: Hello, can you tell me what brought you here today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having a progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for about a week. I also noticed some right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia.
Doctor: I see. Let's talk about when you first presented with these symptoms. Did you experience any conscious disturbance?
Patient: Yes, I had an acute onset conscious disturbance, and my Glasgow Coma Scale was E3VaM5 at the hospital.
Doctor: Okay, we performed a brain computed tomography and found an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic changes. The tumor is located in your left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it's a serious condition. We performed an emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in December 2006. The pathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, consistent with the diagnosis of classic GBM.
Patient: What happened after that?
Doctor: You underwent radiotherapy a month later, followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for six months. Your performance status improved to a Karnofsky Grade of 70, and your clinical condition was stable thereafter.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: However, a follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in June 2014 revealed a new enhanced nodular lesion, about 1.1 cm in diameter, at your left temporal base. The brain MRI in October 2014 showed a progressive change in lesions, with a maximum of 3.0 cm in diameter.
Patient: What did you do about that?
Doctor: We performed another surgery for gross tumor removal. Histologically, the tumors showed the oligodendroglial component. Neoplastic cells also showed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) positivity, diffuse p53 positivity, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) negativity as revealed by immunostaining.
Patient: Hmm, I see.
Doctor: During your follow-up, we noticed signs of increased intracranial pressure in May 2015. As a result, you received a third debulking surgery.
Patient: What did the third pathology reveal?
Doctor: The third pathology revealed both GBM- and PNET-like components. In immunohistochemistry, the PNET-like component exhibited positivity for synaptophysin and CD56 and focal weak positivity for glial fibrillary.
Patient: What's the next step for my treatment?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide further treatment options as needed. It's important to follow up with us regularly to ensure the best possible care.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you have been dealing with hepatocellular carcinoma and had a liver transplantation from a living donor about a year ago. How have you been feeling recently?
Patient: Well, lately I developed some severe abdominal pain that has been really bothersome.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day to control your abdominal pain. Over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day). How has your pain been since then?
Patient: It's been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but it's still quite painful.
Doctor: I see. In addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you mentioned experiencing nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.
Doctor: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 μg/day, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?
Patient: The patch has been helpful; I've noticed a difference.
Doctor: Good to hear. Unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 μg/day. We have been gradually decreasing the dose daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day). As your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms. The discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms. How are you feeling now?
Patient: I'm feeling much better now, thank you.
Doctor: That's great to hear. Make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and let us know if you experience any discomfort or changes in your condition. We will continue to follow up with you to ensure your recovery goes smoothly.","S: The patient, a male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation from a living donor, reports severe abdominal pain that has been bothersome.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some pain in my right chest lately.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about your background? Are you a smoker?
Patient: No, I am a non-smoker. I work as an engineer for a gas company.
Doctor: Alright. Have you had any exposure to asbestos in your workplace?
Patient: No, I don't think so.
Doctor: Let's perform a physical examination to check for any issues in your lungs. [After examination] I noticed a reduction of lung sounds at the right lung basis, but no clinical sign of autoimmune disease.
Patient: Hmm, what could be causing the chest pain then?
Doctor: We will need to perform a chest X-ray (CXR) to investigate further. [After CXR] The results show a considerable reduction in the right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means there is fluid around your right lung. We should perform more tests to determine the cause. [After tests] All serological, autoimmune, and microbiological tests came back negative. Let's do a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a better view. [After CT] The CT scan revealed a slight reduction in right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
Patient: What's the next step?
Doctor: We will conduct a supplemental investigation to rule out any history of trauma, tuberculosis, and pneumothorax. We will also perform an echocardiography to exclude pulmonary hypertension, and a diaphragm dysfunction test through phrenic nerve stimulation. [After investigations] All tests were negative.
Doctor: We'll proceed with a total body positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) to check for any abnormalities. [After PET-CT] There was a low-intensity hyper-accumulation of 18-FDG in the right pleura with increased concentration in the basal, middle, and posterior pleural surface.
Patient: What's the next step, then?
Doctor: We'll perform a surgical lung biopsy (SLB) to identify the issue. [After SLB] The biopsy identified non-specific fibrinous pleurisy, but the search for neoplastic or infectious cells was negative.
Doctor: Unfortunately, your forced vital capacity (FVC) has dropped significantly over the previous 3 years, and you have developed shortness of breath on exertion. I am going to prescribe a prednisolone course to help with the symptoms.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Sadly, your condition has worsened with the onset of restrictive respiratory failure. It's important to keep a close eye on your health and report any changes.
[2 weeks later]
Doctor [to patient's family]: I am sorry to inform you that the patient passed away due to a cardiac ischemic attack. The autopsy excluded mesothelioma or other pleural neoplastic diseases but reported the presence of diffuse fibrinous pleurisy.","S: The patient, a non-smoker, reports experiencing pain in the right chest.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented with body weight loss. Can you tell me about any medical history you have?
Patient: Yes, I have hypertension and diabetes, but both are well-controlled by medication.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. We've done some laboratory tests, and the data shows that your hemoglobin is decreased at 9.1 g/dl. However, your tumor markers are within normal limits.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We performed a colonoscopy which revealed a circumferential tumor in your sigmoid colon. A histological examination of the biopsy showed that it's a RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma. The RAF mutational status was not investigated.
Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed irregular colonic wall thickening with massive involvement of your urinary bladder. There were enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastases but no distant metastasis. Your pretreatment diagnosis is LACC stage IIIC (T4bN2M0).
Patient: So, what's the treatment plan for me?
Doctor: We started with a loop transverse colostomy, similar to some other cases. We then planned 6 courses of chemotherapy with CAPOX plus bevacizumab.
Patient: How did that go?
Doctor: You eventually received 5 courses of CAPOX plus bevacizumab and the remaining 1 course without oxaliplatin due to grade 2 neurotoxicity. A follow-up CT after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed significant tumor shrinkage.
Patient: That's good news.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Thereafter, we performed a sigmoid colectomy and partial resection of your bladder. The postoperative course was uneventful, and you did not suffer from neurogenic voiding dysfunction or urinary incontinence.
Patient: I'm relieved to hear that.
Doctor: Pathological examination revealed that tumor cells or degeneration was present in less than one third of the entire lesion, which was consistent with grade 1a effect according to the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma.
Patient: So, what's the final diagnosis?
Doctor: The final diagnosis is ypT4b, ypN0, M0, ypStage IIC. You subsequently received 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine alone.
Patient: And how am I doing now?
Doctor: There has been no recurrence at 16 months after the initial diagnosis, which is a very positive outcome.
Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you for all your help, Doctor.

"Doctor: Hello, I heard you have a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of your mouth, and you were referred to our institution. How can I help you today?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I've been experiencing some difficulty in swallowing, but I haven't had any pain or tongue paralysis.
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an intraoral examination to better understand the issue. Hmm, I can see a well-defined 3.5 × 3 × 2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland. It's covered with light bluish smooth mucus. Do you feel any pain when I apply pressure to the tumor?
Patient: Yes, I feel slight pain when you press on it.
Doctor: Alright. Your tongue's mobility and sensory functions seem to be normal, and I don't detect any lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region on palpation. We'll need to conduct some laboratory tests and an enhanced computed tomography scan to get a clearer picture of the issue.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
[After the tests]
Doctor: Your lab results are all normal, and the enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a 2.8 × 1.8 × 2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that doesn't appear to involve the mandible. We also found a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the submental or submandibular regions.
Patient: So, what does that mean, doctor?
Doctor: Based on these findings, our initial clinical impression is that this could be a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. We will need to schedule you for surgery via an intraoral approach to remove the tumor and further examine it.
Patient: Alright, so what will the surgery involve?
Doctor: During the surgery, we'll make an elliptical incision around the periphery of the sublingual gland, and prepare a full-thickness tissue flap along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. After freeing the sublingual gland from its surrounding tissue, we'll find the well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension beneath the body of the sublingual gland. We'll carefully free the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve from the tumor surface, and completely excise the tumor along with the sublingual gland.
Patient: I see. What happens after the surgery?
Doctor: After the surgery, we'll fix the tissue sample with 10% formalin and submit it for histopathological diagnosis to determine the exact nature of the tumor.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'm ready to proceed with the surgery and follow-up care.
Doctor: You're welcome. We'll make sure to take good care of you during and after the surgery. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us.","S: The patient, with a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of the mouth, reports difficulty swallowing, but no pain or tongue paralysis.

"Doctor: Hi there, can you please tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Well, I had prostate cancer and underwent a prostatectomy.
Doctor: I see. And what brings you here today?
Patient: I've been experiencing tingling and numbness in my right arm and leg for at least a month. 
Doctor: Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any drugs?
Patient: No, I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs.
Doctor: Your daughter mentioned that you've had an unsteady gait and needed assistance when moving. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's true. It's been really hard for me to walk lately.
Doctor: Okay, let's review your vital signs from the day of admission. Your temperature was 97.9 F, heart rate 68 beats/min, blood pressure 137/84 mmHg, and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. You were alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Now, let's discuss your neurological examination findings. You showed right-sided hemiparesis and significant leg stiffness. Your strength in your right arm was 4/5, and in your right leg, it was 3/5. Your left side was unremarkable.
Patient: Yeah, I've been having difficulty moving my right side.
Doctor: We also found that your cranial nerves 2-10 were normal, but you had difficulty shrugging your right shoulder and couldn't turn your head to the left. When walking, your gait was unsteady, and you compensated with your non-affected side. The rest of your physical examination was within normal limits.
Patient: Okay, what about the tests you did on me?
Doctor: Your laboratory values were within normal limits. We performed a head computed tomography (CT) and a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which were both negative for a stroke. However, your cervical spine CT showed marked degenerative changes, including moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at C4/C5.
Patient: Oh, what does that mean?
Doctor: We performed an MRI of your cervical spine without contrast, which confirmed the moderate to severe central stenosis with cord compression and mildly increased T2 signal at C4/C5 and C5/C6. There were degenerative findings between levels C3-C7, along with hypertrophy.
Patient: So, what's the next step, doctor?
Doctor: Based on these findings, we'll discuss potential treatment options and closely monitor your condition. It's important to follow up with your primary care physician and a specialist to address the spinal stenosis and any related symptoms.","S: The patient reports experiencing tingling and numbness in the right arm and leg for at least a month.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I am a 76-year-old woman and my chief complaint is backache.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have hypertension and lumbar spinal canal stenosis.
Doctor: Have you been treated with an oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent for these conditions?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: When did you first notice the backache?
Patient: The discomfort started about 4 days ago without any obvious cause.
Doctor: Has your backache worsened since then?
Patient: Yes, it aggravated suddenly, and I also had vomiting and difficulty with body movement.
Doctor: Did you seek medical help for these symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I visited the Department of Surgery at your hospital and was admitted for examination and treatment.
Doctor: Were there any abnormal findings on thoracoabdominal CT or endoscopy from a surgical perspective?
Patient: They didn't find anything abnormal, so they referred me to your department.
Doctor: Alright, let's discuss your initial examination. Your body temperature was 36.2°C, blood pressure was 192/109 mmHg, and pulse was 79/min. You had a mild disturbance of orientation with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of E4, V4, M6. Have you experienced a severe headache along with the backache?
Patient: No, just the severe backache.
Doctor: Okay. During your neurological examination, we didn't find any hypesthesia or muscle weakness of the lower limbs. Your deep tendon reflexes were normal, and there were no abnormalities in hemorrhage and coagulation test findings. On plain radiography at admission, there were also no abnormal findings in the thoracolumbar vertebrae. We performed a lumbar spinal MRI 4 days after the onset, which showed a band-like shadow continuous from the thoracic spinal level, with high intensity on T1-weighted imaging and low intensity on T2-weighted imaging, and STIR. To examine the lesion at the upper level more closely, we performed a thoracic spinal MRI 7 days after the onset. It revealed a band-like shadow extending from Th2 to L3 on the subdural extramedullary ventral side. A mass was present in the shadow at Th7, compressing and deforming the spinal cord centered on this region, with changes in intramedullary brightness of Th6.
Patient: That sounds concerning. What does it mean?
Doctor: It indicates that there is a mass compressing your spinal cord which might be causing your backache and other symptoms. We will need to perform further tests and discuss potential treatment options with you.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I'm a 36-year-old gravida 2, para 1 Caucasian woman, and I'm currently 9 weeks pregnant. I've been having headaches lately.
Doctor: I see. Are you experiencing any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms?
Patient: No, just the headaches.
Doctor: Alright. I understand that your previous in vitro fertilization pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia at 27 weeks of gestation, and you delivered a growth-restricted fetus by cesarean section at 36 weeks, weighing 1900 g. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I also see in your file that you have a past history of infrarenal aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed based on a computed tomographic angiogram. This angiogram was done to investigate your persistent hypertension and intermittent claudication postpartum. It showed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with hypertrophied internal mammary and epigastric arteries. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: It seems that your regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Additionally, your family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, you've got it right.
Doctor: During your pregnancy, laboratory investigations for preeclampsia revealed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 40 mg/mmol, as well as normal renal and liver function. Your vasculitic screen showed a normal C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg/L, mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies. Does that sound correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what the tests showed.
Doctor: At 34 weeks, your ultrasound indicated that the estimated fetal weight was in the 94th percentile, and your placental vascular resistance was normal. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. The differential diagnoses for your major finding of significant infrarenal aortic stenosis include congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. In your case, the presence of a well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy.
Patient: Okay, so what does that mean?
Doctor: Since you don't have any clinical history or signs of neurofibromatosis, tuberculosis, or radiation exposure, and there is little evidence of active inflammation, the diagnosis could be chronic abdominal aortopathy from congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis. We will need to continue monitoring your condition and possibly adjust your treatment plan accordingly.
Patient: I understand. What should I do next?
Doctor: We will keep a close eye on your pregnancy and monitor your headaches as well as any potential symptoms related to your aortic stenosis. It is important to continue taking your medications and attending regular check-ups. If you notice any changes in your symptoms or have any concerns, please reach out to us immediately.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been having difficulty walking recently.
Doctor: I see. How long has this been going on?
Patient: It started about three days ago. I felt some discomfort in the front of my knee and it turned into pain the next day.
Doctor: Was there any injury or specific event that could have caused this?
Patient: No, there was no injury or anything that I can think of.
Doctor: Alright. Have you noticed any swelling of the joint?
Patient: No, there's no swelling.
Doctor: Okay. Let me examine your knee. I'll check for tenderness at the medial and lateral femorotibial joint, and other tests like the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, varus/valgus instability, and McMurray test, okay?
Patient: Sure, go ahead.
Doctor: *Performs tests* All those tests were negative, which is a good sign. However, I noticed that your range of motion is severely restricted due to the pain. Did you receive any treatment so far?
Patient: Yes, I was given an intra-articular injection of xylocaine, and it helped temporarily, but then I started feeling a catching sensation in my knee when I moved it.
Doctor: Okay, let's take a look at some imaging tests. *Examines radiographs and MRI* The simple radiographs showed no abnormal findings, but the MRI revealed a soft tissue mass located near your knee joint. It has an ill-defined border and high signal intensities on both T1- and T2-weighted images. On fat-suppressed images, it has low signal intensity, and there's no contrast enhancement in contrast imaging. Your blood examination also showed no abnormal findings.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What do you suggest I do?
Doctor: Considering your persistent symptoms, I recommend surgery to remove the mass. We can perform a knee arthroscopy to get a better look at it and remove it if necessary.
Patient: Okay, I'd like to go ahead with the surgery.
Doctor: *Performs surgery* During the surgery, we found a large fat mass with mobility on the anterior surface of the proximal-lateral PF joint. It looked like fat and had an ill-defined border. We removed it piece by piece through a resection. Histologically, it was mainly composed of connective tissue and fatty tissue, but we didn't find any signs of lipoma, lipoma arborescens, or pigmented villonodular synovitis.
Patient: That's a relief. How are my symptoms now?
Doctor: Your symptoms have improved since the surgery, and there are no more signs of anterior knee pain or any other issues.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you have a history of cholelithiasis. Can you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing on your right side?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having this pain in my right upper abdomen, and it's been quite bothersome.
Doctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.
Patient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?
Doctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.
Patient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?
Doctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.
Patient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?
Doctor: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.
Patient: So, what was done during the surgery?
Doctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.
Patient: How was the ARHD removed?
Doctor: We performed removal and ligation of the ARHD on both the hepatic side and the cystic duct by clipping it using the AESCULAP DS Titanium Lig.
Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. What should I expect during my recovery?
Doctor: You will need to follow up with us regularly so we can monitor your progress and ensure proper healing.

"Doctor: Hello, I received your medical records. You're a 50-year-old African American female, and you presented with a three-week history of intractable headache, confusion, vertical binocular diplopia, photophobia, and difficulty with balance, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. These symptoms have been bothering me for a while now.
Doctor: I see. During the examination, your best corrected visual acuities were 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Your intraocular pressures were 14 mmHg in both eyes, and no afferent pupillary defect was noted. Your extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full in both eyes. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: The anterior segment examination in both eyes was unremarkable. However, the funduscopic examination revealed grade-four optic disc edema, blurring of the optic disc margin, and obscuration of vasculature of the optic nerve. Preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages were present in both eyes, mainly in the peripapillary retina but also extending to the mid-peripheral retina. Are you following so far?
Patient: Yes, I understand.
Doctor: Optic nerve swelling was confirmed on optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Fluorescein angiography revealed hyperfluorescence of the optic disc in both eyes. 
Patient: Okay, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: We also performed computed tomography of the head, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and magnetic resonance venography of the brain. These tests were unremarkable and showed no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or ischemia.
Patient: That's good news, right?
Doctor: Yes, it's good that we didn't find any of those issues. Moving on to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, it revealed an opening pressure of 30 cm H2O, 77 white blood cells/mm3 with 94% lymphocytes, 93 mg/dL protein, and 73 mg/dL glucose.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: Bacterial and fungal cultures of the CSF were negative, as were CSF studies for Lyme, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, and West Nile virus. A limited panel of laboratory studies for enterovirus, syphilis, ANA, and p-ANCA was also negative. Lastly, a respiratory viral panel for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative.
Patient: So, what's causing my symptoms?
Doctor: At this point, we've ruled out many possible causes, but we still need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. It's important for you to have follow-up appointments and additional tests as necessary so we can identify the cause and develop a treatment plan for you.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you are a 53-year-old woman with a posterior, stage IIB NSCLC in the left upper lobe. You've received neoadjuvant carboplatin, pemetrexed, and radiotherapy already. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any discomfort or new symptoms recently?
Patient: Yeah, doctor. I've been having severe left back pain and left axillary numbness and paresthesia.
Doctor: I see. Based on your symptoms, we conducted some tests and found that the tumor has attached to the T2 and T3 vertebrae and infiltrated the corresponding nerve roots. This is likely the cause of your complaints. We consulted the neurosurgery and thoracic surgery services to discuss the best management for your condition.
Patient: What did they recommend, doctor?
Doctor: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies showed that there was no direct tumor invasion of the left brachial plexus or subclavian vessels. After discussing different treatment options, they recommended a posterior approach, image-guided T2 and T3 osteotomy followed by transthoracic en bloc resection of the thoracic tumor.
Patient: Will that help with the pain and numbness?
Doctor: Yes, the operation aims to address the issues caused by the tumor attachment and infiltration. You'll need to give your informed consent for the procedure.
Patient: Alright, I agree to the operation.
Doctor: Great. During the operation, we'll make an initial incision in the operating room and expose the spinal processes, lamina, and transverse processes from T1 through T5 as well as 5 cm of the ribs from the left costovertebral junction on the side of the tumor. We'll then take images with the O-Arm and register your spine to the StealthStation navigation suite using a stereotactic probe.
Patient: What happens next?
Doctor: We'll use spine navigation to place the instrumentation at the level above and below the tumor-infiltrated vertebrae. We won't place screws on the left T2 and T3 vertebrae. The spinous processes and lamina of T2 and T3 will be removed, and the nerve roots will be exposed on the left side.
Patient: And then you'll remove the tumor?
Doctor: Yes, during the resection, we'll notice an infiltration of the ganglia by the primary tumor that is in continuity with the ribs on the left side. We'll proceed with resection, tying the T2 and T3 nerve roots.
Patient: Okay, doctor. I hope this will help with my pain and numbness.
Doctor: We believe it will help to alleviate your symptoms.

"Doctor: Good morning! How can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I am a 70-year-old woman and I was admitted to the cardiovascular department for chest distress for 11 hours. I have been experiencing shortness of breath at rest and difficulty laying in the recumbent position.
Doctor: I see. Have you had any prior medical conditions?
Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus a few years ago and have been taking oral medication for their treatment.
Doctor: Okay, let me explain what happened after your initial admission. After your clinical examination, you were diagnosed with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. You underwent coronary angiography and stent implantation, and during the operation, heparin was administered, which included an arterial intrathecal injection of 2000 units and an intravenous injection of 3500 units.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: After the angiography, we prescribed you aspirin (100 mg per day), TiGraylo (90 mg once every 12 h), and enoxaparin sodium (0.4 mL once every 12 h subcutaneously) for 3 days. Your chest distress and shortness of breath had relieved. However, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: During the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. There was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. We conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin (102 g/L), prolonged prothrombin time (13.4 s), and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: These results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. Moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction. An abdominal CT scan showed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon, and the density of the mass did not significantly change on an enhanced CT scan. The left flexure of the colon was also thick, which could be another hematoma.
Patient: So, what's the treatment for this?
Doctor: We tried conservative treatment, which included stopping your anticoagulant medications, providing total parenteral nutrition, and monitoring your condition. However, your clinical symptoms did not resolve with this approach. We will continue to evaluate your condition and discuss further treatment options with you.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor, for explaining all this to me. I hope we can find a solution soon.","S: The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you are a 64-year-old postmenopausal woman who was referred to our hospital after your first screening colonoscopy revealed an adenocarcinoma. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Based on the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the colonic lesion, it was positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and ER, weakly positive for MOC-31, and negative for CK-20, CD-X2, PR, PAX-8, SOX-10, CD45, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and TTF-1. These findings are consistent with a breast primary. Were you experiencing any symptoms or palpable masses before the colonoscopy?
Patient: No, I was asymptomatic and didn't feel any masses or lymphadenopathy.
Doctor: I see. You mentioned having a surgical history of hysterectomy secondary to symptomatic fibroids. Is your family history negative for cancers?
Patient: Yes, no one in my family has had cancer.
Doctor: Okay. I noticed that you had a screening mammography a month prior, which came back normal. However, a computerized tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in August 2015 showed osteolytic thoracic vertebral and pelvic lesions, as well as bilateral axillary adenopathy measuring up to 1.4 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left. A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) CT in October 2015 revealed metabolic activity in the right axilla and patchy radiotracer uptake involving the vertebral column corresponding to the CT findings. Are you following me so far?
Patient: Yes, I am.
Doctor: In November 2015, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the right axillary lymph node was performed but came back negative for malignancy. Your CEA, CA 19-9, and CA-125 levels were all within normal limits (2.08 ng/mL, <1 U/mL, and 6.4 U/mL, respectively). Were you aware of these test results?
Patient: Yes, I knew about those results.
Doctor: You started seeing an oncologist in March 2016 and were given anastrozole until further workup was done. A repeat mammography and breast ultrasound showed only bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. A bone biopsy of a right sacral lesion confirmed metastatic breast invasive ductal carcinoma with IHC positive for CK-7, GATA-3, ER, and PR but negative for CD45. Do you have any questions about your diagnosis?

[Doctor performs bimanual palpation]
Doctor: I can feel a firm swelling in the posterior floor of your mouth. Based on my assessment, I believe you have right submandibular salivary gland sialolithiasis. We'll need a computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm this diagnosis.
Patient: Okay, so what happens if the CT scan confirms the diagnosis?
Doctor: If the diagnosis is confirmed, we'll need to surgically remove the gland. The surgery will involve making a Risdon incision about 3 to 4 cm below your mandible. We'll identify and protect your marginal mandibular nerve and remove the submandibular gland from the mylohyoid muscle. Then, we'll divide and ligate the submandibular duct to remove the gland along with the calculi. In your case, we found a 7 mm spherical formation.
Patient: Will there be any postoperative complications?

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been experiencing some difficulties in your development. Can you tell me more about the issues you've been facing?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble with attention and I'm always moving around. I also do some repetitive stuff and I'm not good at learning certain things.
Doctor: I see. It's important that we properly evaluate your situation. You mentioned having some learning deficits, can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Well, I mostly struggle with understanding things in logical areas, like math and stuff.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. I noticed that you underwent a neuropsychological evaluation using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) when you were 8.5 years old. The results showed a disharmonic profile with lower scores in the language area (VIQ = 88; PIQ = 117; TIQ = 102). This means that you have some difficulties in understanding, verbal fluency, and auditory attention that are not appropriate for your age. 
Patient: Oh, I see. So, that's why I have problems with learning and attention.
Doctor: Yes, that's correct. It's important for us to identify these issues so we can provide the right support and guidance for you. Do you have any other health problems that you're aware of?
Patient: No, I don't think so. I haven't had any other health issues.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Since we've identified these challenges, we can work on strategies to help you improve in these areas. You might benefit from additional support in school or working with a specialist who understands your unique needs.
Patient: Okay, that sounds helpful. What should I do next?
Doctor: I would recommend discussing your situation with your parents and your school to see what support services are available. In the meantime, try to be patient with yourself and remember that everyone learns at their own pace.
Patient: Yeah, I'll talk to my parents about it. Thanks for the advice.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've come in today for an evaluation of worsening dyspnea, cough, and hypoxemia. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having more trouble breathing lately, and I've developed a cough. I also feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen.
Doctor: I understand. Based on your medical history, you have limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Do you have any history of atopy or food allergies?
Patient: No, I don't. I do use an albuterol inhaler as needed though.
Doctor: That's helpful to know. Your PAH was diagnosed seven years ago, with a reported pulmonary artery pressure of 80/39 mmHg, mean PA pressure of 56 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mmHg, and cardiac output by thermodilution of 3.17 L/min. Your pulmonary function tests at that time showed a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.06 L (75% predicted) and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 19.61 mL/min/mm Hg (66% predicted). You were treated with dual therapy, tadalafil and macitentan, for PAH and were able to wean from oxygen supplementation. How has this treatment been working for you?
Patient: It worked well for a while, but recently I've been feeling worse.
Doctor: I see. Your ILD was considered mild, and you didn't require supplemental oxygen at rest or with exertion. You were treated with mycophenolate mofetil for a year after your initial diagnosis. However, you discontinued this medication about 6 years ago due to fear of reactivating remote Lyme infection after reading about chronic Lyme disease on the internet. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Your medical records indicate that you had been stable on your regimen of tadalafil and macitentan until 3 months ago when you began to experience rapidly progressive dyspnea and new onset hypoxemia. A recent right heart catheterization (RHC) revealed that your PAH had worsened, with a mean PA pressure of 72 mmHg and a new drop in cardiac index (1.7 L/min/m2). As a result, you were started on subcutaneous treprostinil. How have you been feeling since starting this new medication?
Patient: I'm still not feeling great. My breathing has been getting worse, and the cough hasn't gone away.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll need to closely monitor your symptoms and possibly adjust your medications. It's important to keep up with your regular appointments and let us know if there are any changes in your condition. In the meantime, continue using your albuterol inhaler as needed.
Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to keep you updated and come in for regular check-ups.
Doctor: Thank you. I hope we can find a treatment plan that works well for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime.

"Doctor: Good morning! What brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling sick for the past four days. I've had a fever, muscle pain, and vomiting. I've also noticed I've been drinking a lot of water, peeing a lot, waking up at night to pee, and losing weight for about a month now.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any prior underlying diseases? 
Patient: No, I don't have any underlying diseases.
Doctor: What about your family history? Is there any history of diabetes mellitus in your family?
Patient: No, there's no family history of diabetes.
Doctor: Okay, and do you use tobacco, alcohol, or any illicit drugs?
Patient: No, I don't use any of those.
Doctor: Alright. Let's check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 115/78 mm Hg, your temperature is 36.6°C, and your pulse rate is 96 beats per min. You appear to be mildly dehydrated.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: We've also performed some tests. Your venous plasma glucose was recorded at 467 mg/dL, and there are wide anion gap metabolic acidosis and high levels of serum beta-hydroxybutyrate present. Based on these findings, you have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Don't worry; we'll start treating you right away. We've already given you 1 liter of isotonic saline over one hour, and we'll continue to administer it at 500 mL/hr. We'll also replete your potassium levels and give you a bolus of insulin, followed by continuous insulin infusion. We've also done an electrocardiogram that showed sinus tachycardia, and a chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: Additionally, we've found that you have a dengue infection based on your laboratory results. A systemic review revealed that you currently have vaginal bleeding. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is evidenced by hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic manifestation in your case.
Patient: Oh no, that's concerning.
Doctor: After six hours of treatment, you mentioned you had chest discomfort and developed puffy eyelids and mild pitting edema in both legs. Upon lung examination, we heard fine crepitation in both lungs. A chest x-ray revealed bilateral hilar congestion. These abnormalities occurred after the administration of 3 L of isotonic saline.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: We detected leakage syndrome, so we've decreased the rate of intravenous fluid from 140 to 60 mL/hr. We'll closely monitor your urine output every hour and manage your fluid balance to be negative. This will help improve your condition.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. With these adjustments, your clinical status should gradually improve. We'll continue to monitor your progress and make any necessary changes in your treatment. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to ask.

"Doctor: Hi there! I see you've presented with hoarseness and dysphagia for the past three months following an upper respiratory infection. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, my voice has been really hoarse, and I've had trouble swallowing too.
Doctor: I understand. I also noticed in your past medical history that you had invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, which was ER positive, PR negative, and HER2 negative. You were treated with a mastectomy two years prior to this presentation. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: During the clinical examination, we found paralysis of your right vocal cord. We also performed a CT scan of your neck, which revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
Patient: No, not really. Just the hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.
Doctor: Okay. We performed a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule, which was initially diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance, falling under Bethesda category III. We did a repeat FNA three months later, and it yielded a diagnosis of benign follicular nodule, which is Bethesda category II. 
Patient: I see.
Doctor: Due to your persistent hoarseness and compressive symptoms, as well as the atypical findings on the initial FNA, we decided to proceed with a right thyroid lobectomy and a right vocal cord injection. Intraoperatively, we observed that your right thyroid lobe was moderately enlarged with multiple nodules but no evidence of extrathyroidal extension.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: The right lobectomy specimen measured 4.6 cm in greatest dimension and weighed 16 grams. Upon further examination, we found multiple variably sized brown gelatinous nodules with focal areas of hemorrhage and cystic change in the thyroid parenchyma.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: The histologic examination revealed evidence of nodular thyroid hyperplasia. We also found multiple scattered subcentimeter foci of metastatic breast carcinoma, which were present in 7 out of the 16 submitted tissue sections. Most of these smaller metastatic foci measured around 1 millimeter each and consisted of irregularly shaped nests of epithelioid tumor cells between thyroid follicles.
Patient: Oh, no.
Doctor: The largest metastatic focus measured 0.6 cm and was comprised of tumor cell nests arranged along the periphery of a sclerotic stroma with cords of tumor cells showing retraction artifact. These areas resembled the dense amyloid-type stroma often seen in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Additionally, we observed numerous areas of rimming of the thyroid follicles by the tumor cells, which mimicked the appearance of C cell hyperplasia (CCH).
Patient: What should I do now?
Doctor: We'll need to discuss your treatment options and closely monitor your condition. We'll work together to determine the best course of action moving forward. It's important to stay vigilant and report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare team.

"Doctor: Hello, I wanted to discuss your current situation and review your surgical history with you. Can you tell me what brought you to our facility initially?
Patient: Yes, I came in with a strangulated large bowel and ventral hernia, 10 years after my LAGB procedure.
Doctor: That's correct. At that time, you were still morbidly obese and had been lost to follow-up. We performed an emergency surgical hernia repair, which included resection of the necrotic transverse colon, and created a loop ileostomy. One year later, you presented with a LAGB port-site infection. Do you remember what we did during that time?
Patient: Yes, you removed the port and sutured the tubing to my abdominal wall.
Doctor: Exactly. During both admissions, we observed the LAGB tubing in a stable position adjacent to the transverse colon on the CT scans, with no concerns for penetration. Six months after the port-site infection, we elected to reverse the ileostomy. However, there were complications in the early post-operative period. Can you tell me about those symptoms?
Patient: I remember feeling really sick and ended up having abdominal sepsis.
Doctor: Yes, that's correct. The abdominal CT demonstrated transection of the remaining proximal transverse colon by the LAGB tubing. Due to this, we had to perform a right hemicolectomy, which involved the removal of the gastric band and tubing, and we created an end ileostomy. 
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what's the plan moving forward, doctor?
Doctor: Our main focus now is to ensure proper healing and monitor for any complications. We'll keep a close eye on your progress and address any issues that may arise.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented to the Retina Service today. Can you tell me a bit about what brought you here?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been experiencing metamophopsia and reduced visual acuity in both of my eyes. It's been gradually worsening over the past four months.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Well, I suffer from beta thalassemia intermedia and I've been receiving blood transfusions biweekly and chelation therapy for the past 14 years. My chelation therapy includes DFO, which I take 5 times a week by an 8-hourly subcutaneous infusion, and deferiprone, which I take daily. My ferritin level is within normal limits. I also have hypothyroidism and I'm treated with levothyroxine. I don't have any history of color or peripheral vision changes or hearing impairment.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing your medical history. Let's get to the examination. Your best corrected visual acuity is 20/25 in your right eye and 20/22 in your left eye. Slit lamp biomicroscopy did not reveal any pathology in the anterior segment, and your intraocular pressure measured by applanation tonometry is 14 mmHg in both eyes. 
Patient: Okay, what about my dilated fundus examination?
Doctor: Your dilated fundus examination showed a yellowish roundish macular lesion surrounded by RPE changes, as well as angioid streaks emanating from the optic disc sparing the macula in both eyes. The retinal vasculature appeared normal.
Patient: What did the Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography show?
Doctor: The SD-OCT revealed a subfoveal hyperreflective deposit above the level of the RPE corresponding to the lesion observed fundoscopically. Additionally, mild stippling was noticed in the macular area in fundus autofluorescence.
Patient: And the fluoroscein angiography?
Doctor: Fluoroscein angiography revealed staining of the macular lesion in the late phases of the angiogram. Based on your history and examination, we need to evaluate for possible DFO retinopathy in your case.
Patient: How will you do that?
Doctor: We will perform electrophysiology testing, specifically a full-field electroretinogram, to assess your retinal function and determine if DFO retinopathy is present.
Patient: Alright, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. What should I do for follow-up?

Patient: Yes, I have a history of dyslipidemia and hypertension. But no diabetes. My father also had hypertension.
Doctor: Alright. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
Patient: I quit smoking 17 months ago, and I don't drink alcohol.
Doctor: Good to hear. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm on captopril, bisoprolol, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and atorvastatin.
Doctor: Have you been compliant with your warfarin regimen?
Patient: To be honest, I haven't been very compliant, especially a few weeks after hospital discharge and at 7 and 13 months before this admission.
Doctor: I understand. We did an Electrocardiography and it showed sinus rhythm of 54 beats/minute, left ventricular hypertrophy, horizontal ST-segment depression, and T wave inversion at leads I, aVL, and V4–6. A biphasic T wave was observed at lead V2–3. 
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: It indicates some abnormalities in your heart's electrical activity. We also checked your laboratory results. Your international normalized ratio (INR) is suboptimal at 1.28. The level of triglycerides is 273 mg/dL; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are within normal limits. The complete blood count and levels of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase–myocardial band (CK-MB), and high-sensitivity troponin (hs-troponin) T are all normal.
Patient: So, what's the plan, doc?
Doctor: We've given you a loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel along with fondaparinux to alleviate your symptoms. We also performed a Coronary Angiography (CAG) which showed an ectatic and turbulent mid-distal right coronary artery (RCA) and slow flow.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you originally had a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band 4 years ago. What brings you to the bariatric surgery clinic today?
Patient: Yeah, that's right. Lately, I've had trouble tolerating solid foods.
Doctor: I see. We did a work-up and found that your gastric band is still in good position, but you have oesophagitis and gastritis, causing swelling of the mucosa at the band site. We removed the fluid from the reservoir and treated you conservatively with anti-reflux medication and a full liquid diet. How have your symptoms been after 2 weeks of treatment?
Patient: They've improved a lot, thanks!
Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. After careful consideration, you decided to undergo revisional surgery to convert the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy. You went through the appropriate multidisciplinary team and were found to be a suitable candidate for surgery. The surgery went well, and there were no complications. You were discharged on post-operative day 3. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I've been okay, but on post-operative day 12, I started feeling lightheaded and short of breath, so I went to the hospital.
Doctor: Yes, you were readmitted to an outside tertiary care hospital and found to have leukocytosis, with a high white blood cell count of 18,000 cells μl–1. A CT scan with intravenous contrast was performed, and you were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. You were immediately transferred to our center for definitive care.
Patient: That's right, and when I arrived here, you all reviewed my CT films.
Doctor: Yes, our radiologists noticed there was air and a faint suggestion of oral contrast outside of the suture line. Given this finding, we ordered an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) evaluation. During the early phase, no leak was observed, partly due to the slow passage of 30 ml oral non-ionic contrast.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Some residual contrast from the outside hospital CT was present in the transverse and descending colon. Only after delayed imaging and administration of additional non-ionic contrast were we able to determine the situation more accurately.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I'm a 48-year-old woman and I've noticed a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of my left ring finger. I have a history of enchondroma in the same location.
Doctor: I see. Let's perform an ultrasound examination to get a better understanding of the mass.
(Doctor conducts the ultrasound examination)
Doctor: The ultrasound examination revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass that is connected to the medullary cavity through the interrupted bone cortex. There are no obvious blood signals or calcification in this area. Unfortunately, it's difficult to characterize or classify the mass using traditional ultrasound methods.
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what does that mean for me, doctor?
Doctor: Based on the ultrasound findings, we can confirm that there is a mass located close to the bone. However, due to the limitations of the ultrasound, we cannot precisely determine the nature of the mass. We have included these findings in our ultrasound diagnostic report.
Patient: Hmm, so what's the next step?
Doctor: The next step would be a more detailed examination, such as an MRI or a biopsy, to better understand the nature of the mass and determine the appropriate treatment options.
Patient: Okay, when can we schedule that?
Doctor: I'll have my assistant schedule the MRI or biopsy for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, please monitor any changes in the mass or if you experience any discomfort or pain.
Patient: Alright, thank you, doctor.

"Doctor: Hello PT, how can I help you today?
PT: Hey doc, I've been having some issues with memory lately. I've been experiencing recurrent amnesia when I wake up, with disorientation and repetitive questioning, which only lasts for a few minutes.
Doctor: I see, any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PT: Yeah, I've also had these 30-second trance-like episodes during the day. My partner reported that sometimes I make repetitive swallowing movements, followed by disorientation and repetitive questioning. These episodes occur in clusters of up to seven per day.
Doctor: Are you aware of these episodes when they happen?
PT: Well, I'm aware of some of them, but not all. I do have partial recollection of being unable to remember things during those times.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other changes in your memory?
PT: Yes, I've noticed that I lose newly acquired memories over days, and I have difficulty recalling autobiographical events from my adulthood and familiar routes.
Doctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms along with these memory issues?
PT: I've developed olfactory hallucinations that smell like candy floss, which can last for up to a day and seem to happen independently of the amnestic episodes. I also feel like my sense of smell has become a bit blunted. Plus, I've been having headaches with migrainous features, postural arm tremor, tingling in my legs, malaise, and low mood.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Can you tell me about your medical history?
PT: My medical history is mostly unremarkable, but I did have symptoms of depression last year and a history of heavy alcohol use in the past.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, we conducted several tests and investigations. Your initial brain MRI showed subtly increased T2 signal in the right hippocampus, even in the absence of any recent episodes. Your EEG was normal, and the clinical examination revealed no focal neurological signs. We made an initial clinical diagnosis of TEA.
Doctor: We started treating you with lamotrigine, starting at 25 mg and gradually increasing it up to 100 mg twice a day. This resolved your trance-like and amnestic attacks. However, your other symptoms, such as headaches, tingling sensation in your limbs, and olfactory hallucinations, still persist.
PT: Oh, okay. So what's the next step in my treatment plan?
Doctor: Since the lamotrigine has resolved your amnestic attacks, we will continue monitoring your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. We will also further investigate your other symptoms to find the best course of action. In the meantime, please keep track of your symptoms and report any changes to us.
PT: Sounds good, doc. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome, PT. We'll work together to manage your symptoms, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.","S: PT reports experiencing recurrent amnesia when wake up, with disorientation and repetitive questioning, which only lasts for a few minutes.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing constant blurry vision in my left eye for about 6 weeks now.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Yeah, I have cystic fibrosis, which has led to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic sinusitis, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.
Doctor: Have you had any surgeries in the past?
Patient: I had sinus surgery about 7 months ago. It involved bilateral maxillary antrostomies, ethmoidectomies, sphenoidectomies, and frontal sinusotomies.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm taking albuterol, azithromycin, itraconazole, insulin, lisinopril, pancreatic enzymes, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.
Doctor: Do you use tobacco or any drugs?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Alright. At the time of presentation, your visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, intraocular pressure was 18 OD and 16 OS, and your pupils were 4 mm and reactive in both eyes. Your anterior exam was unremarkable, but your posterior exam in the left eye showed intraretinal hemorrhages along the nerve fiber layer with associated retinal thickening in the inferior macula, consistent with a BRVO.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: We also performed optical coherence tomography which revealed mild intraretinal and trace subfoveal fluid in your left eye. These findings were confirmed with a fluorescein angiogram, which showed delayed venous filling in the inferior venous arcade.
Patient: Okay, so what does that mean?
Doctor: It means there might be an issue with the blood vessels in your eye. Your blood pressure readings have been consistently between 110 and 145 systolic over 70-85 diastolic in the past year, and your most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.9% 4 months prior to presentation. We also did a laboratory workup.
Patient: What did the lab results show?
Doctor: The complete blood cell count, Vitamin A and D levels, prothrombin time, thrombin time, antithrombin activity, Protein C and S activity, cardiolipins, dilute Russell's viper venom time, homocysteine level, and a negative prothrombin G20210A mutation were all normal. Your complete metabolic panel showed a mild elevation in glucose of 121 mg/dL, and your antinuclear antibody was weakly elevated at 2.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: The results indicate that there might be an issue with your blood vessels related to your blurry vision. We will need to monitor your blood pressure and glucose levels closely and consider further testing or treatment options based on your progress.
Patient: Alright, thank you for the information.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a past medical history that includes a two-year history of umbilical hernia, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, gout, chronic kidney disease with proteinuria, diverticulosis, obesity, and osteoarthritis. What brings you to the clinic today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. Over the past two months, I've developed pain in my umbilical hernia. The pain is localized to the periumbilical region and left lower back. It gets worse with food intake, and sometimes I take a 5 mg hydrocodone tablet to relieve it.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms in this period?
Patient: Yes, I have had nausea and lost fifteen pounds because I've been eating less.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. During your physical examination, we found a 1 cm tender and irreducible mass superior to the umbilicus. We performed a herniorrhaphy, and the gross examination of the surgical specimen did not reveal any masses or lesions. However, the microscopic evaluation showed diffuse infiltration of the connective tissue by malignant cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does that mean?
Doctor: There were also focal areas of gland formation with mucin production, which is consistent with adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry showed that the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for pancytokeratin and CK7, and negative for CK20, CDX2, TTF-1, and PSA.
Patient: What do the laboratory findings show?
Doctor: Your lab results showed elevated levels of CA 19-9 (16,590 U/mL) and CEA (14.2 ng/mL). We performed a subsequent computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast, which revealed a 5.0 × 2.7 cm ill-defined and hypoattenuating mass located in the pancreatic tail and body, with peripancreatic fat infiltration and vascular involvement of the splenic artery and vein.
Patient: Are there any other findings from the imaging?
Doctor: Yes, the imaging also showed peritoneal carcinomatosis, multiple ill-defined hypoattenuating lesions in the liver, and enlarged and hypoattenuating pericecal iliac lymph nodes.
Patient: How does my current condition compare to my prior scan?
Doctor: Your prior noncontrast computed tomography scan from four months ago showed an umbilical hernia with fat, but there were no other lesions in the pancreas and abdomen at that time.
Patient: What will be the next steps for my treatment, doctor?
Doctor: Given the findings, we need to discuss your case with a multidisciplinary team to determine the best course of action for your treatment. This may include chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. We will keep you informed and involve you in the decision-making process.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your obstetric history?
Patient: I've been pregnant 6 times, had 3 normal deliveries and 2 induced abortions.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What brings you to our emergency department today?
Patient: I've been having an acute and persistent dull pain in the right lower quadrant of my abdomen for the past few hours, and I'm really worried about it.
Doctor: I see. Are there any other symptoms you're experiencing, such as sweating, nausea, or vomiting?
Patient: Yes, I've been having rebound pain, cold sweating, and nausea, but no vomiting. There aren't any factors that seem to relieve or aggravate the pain.
Doctor: Okay. When was your last menstrual cycle?
Patient: It was about 7 weeks and 4 days ago.
Doctor: Do you have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Can you tell me about your past medical history? Have you had any infections or procedures?
Patient: I had a human papilloma virus infection, and I received 3 doses of the Gardasil vaccination about 7 years ago. I also had an intrauterine device inserted 4 years ago, was diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3, had a cervical conization procedure 3.5 years ago, and underwent laparoscopic tubal sterilization about 1 year and 4 months ago.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. During your initial physical examination, we noticed abdominal stiffness and tenderness upon palpation. We also conducted a urine pregnancy test, and it came back positive. A transvaginal ultrasound showed no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy, but we did find a right adnexal mass and minimal ascites. Your lab data revealed a serum β-hCG level of 15795 million IU/mL, a white blood cell count of 12300/μL, and a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, clinical signs, imaging, and high level of serum β-hCG, we highly suspect an ectopic pregnancy. We will admit you for a surgical intervention tomorrow. However, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as vomiting, sudden syncope, or hypotension, you need to let us know immediately.
Patient: Okay, I understand. Thank you.
[14 hours after admission]
Patient's Family Member: Doctor, my sister just experienced vomiting, sudden syncope, and her blood pressure dropped to 79/42 mm Hg. What's going on?
Doctor: We just received her latest lab test results, and her hemoglobin level has dropped to 8.9 g/dL. This, combined with her symptoms, leads us to suspect that her ectopic pregnancy may have ruptured and caused hypovolemic shock. We will need to take her for an immediate surgical intervention to manage this critical situation.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of ASD, developmental delay, and hypotonia. Can you tell me about your birth?
Patient: Yeah, I was born to non-consanguineous Caucasian parents at term by caesarean section. I weighed 6 lb, 14 oz at birth.
Doctor: Thank you. I see that your mother was on citalopram during her pregnancy for the treatment of depression. Now, let's discuss your medical history. You were diagnosed with grade five vesicoureteral reflux in infancy with a dysplastic kidney on the left, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: You also experienced absence seizures at 3 months of age and again at 9 years. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yeah, I had those seizures, but an EEG at 9 months of age was normal. They did a computed tomography scan of my brain at three months, and it showed delayed myelination.
Doctor: I see. Your brain MRI at two and a half years showed hypoplastic olfactory nerves, a Klippel-Feil anomaly, and incomplete myelin maturation in the inferior frontal lobes and temporal tips. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's what they told me.
Doctor: Throughout your childhood, your growth parameters were at or below the third percentile. You were hypotonic, and there was a history of severe constipation. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, I've always had trouble with constipation and didn't grow as fast as other kids.
Doctor: I also see that you had delayed developmental milestones and were diagnosed with ASD at about two and a half years. At around 11 years of age, you experienced symptoms of anxiety and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), although no official diagnosis was given. Have you tried any medications for these symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I tried several anti-anxiety medications, but none of them worked. I'm currently on resperidone.
Doctor: Have you received any behavioural therapy for these issues?
Patient: Yes, I've been in therapy since my ASD diagnosis.
Doctor: Your clinical genetic assessments at 3 and 5 years of age did not identify a specific genetic diagnosis. Clinical CMA, fragile X testing, and metabolic testing were reported to be normal. However, we have identified a de novo KMT2A frameshift variant, c.6169del (p.Val2057Tyrfs*18; Supplementary Fig.) via WGS.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Based on this information and your clinical features (Fig.), such as microcephaly, hypertrichosis, and your history of growth and developmental delay, hypotonia, constipation, and ASD, you have been diagnosed with Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WSS) at the age of 13.
Patient: I see. So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: This diagnosis helps us understand your symptoms and challenges better. We will continue to monitor your condition, and it's important to maintain your current treatments, such as behavioral therapy and medication. We'll also discuss any new recommendations or changes to your treatment plan as needed.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've been admitted for anemia and thrombocytopenia. Can you tell me about your symptoms prior to this presentation?
Patient: Yeah, about 3 weeks ago, I developed a febrile erythematous rash. Then, a week before admission, I had a fever again, and I felt really tired. I also had vomiting and non-bloody diarrhea.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. And do you have any family history of kidney or hematological disorders?
Patient: No, my parents and my three siblings are all healthy.
Doctor: That's good to know. When I examined you, I noticed you appeared pale and had bruises on your abdomen, back, and lower extremities. Your laboratory work-up showed hemolytic anemia with marked reticulocytosis, presence of schistocytes, profound thrombocytopenia, and elevated uric acid. Your serum creatinine levels were normal, though.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: Furthermore, your plasma haptoglobin was undetectable, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated, and the direct Coombs test was negative. Your anti-streptolysin titers were only marginally elevated.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: Your D-dimers were increased to 2.49 μg/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units with the normal range being 0.02–0.47 μg/mL. Prothrombin, international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and C3 and C4 concentrations were normal. However, your sC5b-9 was increased to 653 ng/mL, with the normal range being less than 300 ng/mL.
Patient: Oh, wow.
Doctor: We also conducted a urinalysis, which revealed microscopic erythrocyturia and mild proteinuria. On Day 2 of your stay, you received transfusions of red blood cells and platelets.
Patient: Yeah, I remember that.
Doctor: Despite the transfusions, your hemoglobin (Hb) continued to fall to 48 g/L, and your platelet count dropped to 5 × 10^9/L within 2 days.
Patient: That's not good.
Doctor: Based on all of these findings, we made a tentative diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). We administered a single dose of eculizumab, which is approximately 900 mg/m2, 2 days after admission. You were also vaccinated as a precaution.
Patient: Okay. So, what's next?

Patient: Yes, that's fine.
[Doctor performs the examination]
Doctor: Your examination findings show that you have superficial and deep tenderness in your right lower abdominal quadrant when I palpate, and localized tenderness when I use percussion. I'm going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
[Ultrasound results come in]
Doctor: Your ultrasound results show findings consistent with acute complicated appendicitis. Because of this, we will start you on intravenous antimicrobial treatment, which includes cefotaxime and metronidazole. We'll also need to take you to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy.
Patient: Oh, okay. What does the surgery involve?
Doctor: A laparoscopic appendectomy is a minimally invasive surgery to remove your inflamed appendix. We'll make a few small incisions in your abdomen, insert a laparoscope to view the area, and then remove the appendix.
Patient: Will you test the fluid in my abdomen too?
Doctor: Yes, we will take a fluid culture during the surgery to identify any bacteria that may be present.
[After the surgery]
Doctor: The surgery went well, and we were able to remove your inflamed appendix. The fluid culture revealed the presence of P. aeruginosa, Str. viridans, and Gemella morbillorum bacteria. We will continue your antibiotic treatment to ensure a full recovery.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea and swelling on your hands and face for at least three days. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble breathing and the swelling has been getting worse. I'm a nonsmoker and don't have any chronic diseases.
Doctor: I understand. Due to the worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia, you were initially treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation. However, since your condition worsened, you were intubated and invasive mechanical ventilation was used. On your physical examination, we auscultated mild crackles bilateral on the lower lung zones. Your chest X-ray showed bilateral nonhomogenous infiltration at the middle and lower zones.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: At first, your fraction of inhaled oxygenation (FiO2) was 80% on mechanical ventilation, but your PaO2 was 65 mmHg. We applied lung protective mechanical ventilation strategies, fluid replacement, antibiotics, and other medical treatments. Over time, your FiO2 level decreased, and you were weaned from mechanical ventilation on your fifth day in the ICU.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: After weaning, we noticed that your oral secretions increased and your left nasolabial sulcus wiped out. On your neurological examination, no abnormal findings were found except for left facial paralysis. We didn't find any pathological issues on your cranial computed tomography (CT) or cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Patient: So, what's causing the facial paralysis?
Doctor: You were diagnosed with peripheral facial paralysis (PFP) and prescribed intravenous steroid treatment of 1 milligram per kilogram methylprednisolone by a neurologist. Around the same time, a dermatological lesion occurred. On your dermatologic examination, we detected oedema on your face, pustular lesions on your skin, and a fissure on your tongue. A labium mucosal biopsy was taken, and mucositis was reported.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: When we talked about your symptoms, you informed us that you had recurrent and spontaneous facial paralysis in previous years. Based on your medical history, signs of orofacial oedema, fissure on the tongue, and PFP, you were diagnosed with MRS.
Patient: I remember having those symptoms before.
Doctor: Given your diagnosis, you were transferred from the ICU to the department of neurology for further care and treatment. We will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 50-year-old Chinese man with no prior illnesses. Can you tell me what brought you here today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been having a fever, headache, and vomiting for about a month now.
Doctor: I see. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your brain and it showed multiple varying sizes of ring-enhancing lesions scattered in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. This suggests either a metastatic brain tumour or an infection. We also did a Computer Tomographic (CT) scan of your thorax and found a 6.5 cm x 4.5 cm mass in the right upper lobe, which is suspicious for primary lung malignancy.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, we needed to investigate further. Your blood tests showed mild leucocytosis of 11.7 x 103/uL and a normal C-reactive protein of 1.5 mg/L. We also performed a lumbar puncture to check your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It demonstrated raised intracranial pressure of 26 cm H2O, elevated cell count of 260 cells/mm3 with 90% lymphocyte predominance, low glucose of 1.9 mmol/L, and raised protein at 1.15 g/L.
Patient: What do those numbers mean, Doctor?
Doctor: These results indicate an infection. Initial mucicarmine and India Ink staining did not demonstrate organisms, but further tests detected CSF cryptococcal antigen, and CSF fungal culture grew C. gattii. Your blood cryptococcal antigen was also detected at a titre of 1:1280. Importantly, your human immunodeficiency virus testing came back negative.
Patient: So, it's an infection, not a tumor?
Doctor: That's correct. We performed a bronchoscopy to further evaluate the right upper lobe mass. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed thick-walled fungal yeast forms with narrow-based budding, consistent with Cryptococcus yeasts. These were highlighted by mucicarmine special stain. The bronchoscopic biopsies showed non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltrates in the bronchial wall epithelium and lung parenchyma.
Patient: What does this mean for my treatment?
Doctor: You've been given induction anti-fungal therapy, which includes four weeks of amphotericin B and two weeks of flucytosine. After that, you'll be on maintenance therapy with oral fluconazole.
Patient: And what about the raised intracranial pressure?
Doctor: We've been performing therapeutic lumbar punctures to help treat the raised intracranial pressure. You'll continue to have these procedures during your outpatient follow-up.
Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me, Doctor.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Let me do a deep palpation to check for any discomfort or peritoneal signs. *performs palpation* It seems there's some discomfort on deep palpation, but no peritoneal signs. We'll need to run some tests to further investigate the issue.
Patient: Okay, Doctor.
Doctor: *after running tests* Your white blood cell count is mildly elevated, and you have low potassium, which we've replaced. The computed tomography scan indicates that you might have a small bowel obstruction.
Patient: Oh, no. What does that mean, and what should I do now?
Doctor: We'll admit you to the hospital for further examination and treatment. We'll perform a small bowel follow-through to confirm the diagnosis.
*the next day*
Doctor: The small bowel follow-through revealed moderate distention of the stomach, multiple distended small bowel loops, and no evidence of contrast in the cecum at 14 hours. This is consistent with a small bowel obstruction. We'll need to take you to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy to address the issue.
Patient: I understand. What could have caused this obstruction?
Doctor: *after surgery* During the exploratory laparotomy, we performed a retrieval of a foreign body via an enterotomy. It appears that you ingested a pineapple core the day prior to your symptoms. The pineapple core was acting as a source of fiber, which may have contributed to the obstruction.
Patient: Oh, I didn't realize that could cause a problem. I'm glad it's been taken care of.
Doctor: Your surgery went well, and you're recovering nicely. We'll continue to monitor your progress, and if all goes well, you'll be discharged from the hospital soon.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this process.","S: The patient is a 52-year-old female with no past medical or surgical history.

"Doctor: Hello, thank you for coming in today. I understand you've been admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dysphagia and significant body weight loss over the past 3 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.
Doctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.
Doctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. 
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.
Patient: Oh, that's a relief.
Doctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. 
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. 
Patient: So what's the next step, doc?
Doctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.
Patient: Alright, if that's what's needed.
Doctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.
Patient: Okay, I understand. When will the surgery be scheduled?
Doctor: We'll work on scheduling the surgery as soon as possible and inform you of the date. In the meantime, please follow any preoperative instructions provided by our staff, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you've been referred to our department due to worsening hoarseness over the last 8 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, along with the hoarseness, I sometimes have trouble swallowing and feel like there's a foreign body in my throat.
Doctor: I see. Upon referral, it was reported that you have been a heavy smoker for 20 years, smoking about 20 cigarettes per day. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: And it seems that you also frequently consume alcohol, though not to the point of abuse. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, I do drink quite often but never really overdo it.
Doctor: In your medical history, it shows that you have arterial hypertension and are currently under treatment with beta blockers. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking them for a while now.
Doctor: Good to know. Your hematological and biochemical tests did not show any significant abnormalities. Now, let's discuss your physical examination. We performed a full head and neck examination, along with a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. The typical ear, nose, and throat examination didn't reveal any abnormal findings, and neck palpation was negative.
Patient: Okay, that's good news.
Doctor: However, the fiberoptic laryngoscopy did reveal a lesion affecting both vocal cords and the anterior commissure. Your vocal cord mobility also appeared impaired. Based on these findings, we decided to conduct a cervicothoracic and upper abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous gadolinium and scheduled you for direct microlaryngoscopy and a biopsy of the lesion under general anesthesia.
Patient: I see, so what did the imaging show?
Doctor: The imaging confirmed the laryngeal lesion, but it also indicated a second lesion about 2 cm below the inferior end of the primary one, between the first and second tracheal ring. The intermediate tissue appeared grossly normal. No signs of enlarged cervical lymph nodes were noted, and laryngeal cartilages showed no abnormal findings.
Patient: So, what does that mean?
Doctor: The histopathological examination after the biopsy confirmed that you have squamous cell carcinoma. The lesion is a glottic carcinoma affecting the anterior commissure and is strongly correlated with the thyroid cartilage. The lesion has infiltrated the left and the first tertile of the right vocal cord. No subglottic extension was noted. We informed you about these findings and obtained consent for radical surgical therapy.
Patient: Yes, I remember discussing that with you.
Doctor: I'm glad. So, you underwent a total laryngectomy and wide excision of the trachea, which included the removal of the second tumor within safe limits. How are you feeling now?
Patient: I'm still recovering, but I'm hopeful that things will get better.
Doctor: That's a good attitude. We'll continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary follow-up care. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

"Doctor: Hi there, I'm the pediatric endocrinologist. I understand that your baby was referred to me because a uterus was detected on ultrasonography. Can you please provide some background information about the pregnancy and birth?
Mother: Yes, I had a difficult pregnancy. The baby was born at 23 weeks of gestation by C-section due to preeclampsia and premature membrane rupture. My husband and I are first cousins, and I've had two abortions in the past.
Doctor: I see. What was the birth weight of your baby?
Mother: He was very small, only 680 grams at birth.
Doctor: That is quite small indeed. I understand that the baby had to be intubated and given surfactant treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation support. Is that correct?
Mother: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: The baby has bilateral cryptorchidism and hypospadias, which are likely associated with the severe prematurity. Since the gender assessment at birth was made as male, the baby received a male name and identity card. Can you tell me about your maternal history during pregnancy?
Mother: I was treated with progesterone for one month between the 16th and 20th gestational weeks and also with salicylic acid throughout the pregnancy. There was no evidence of virilisation, such as acne, hirsutism, deep voice, or clitoral enlargement.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination of the baby, we found complete labioscrotal fusion and a single urogenital meatus, consistent with Prader stage-3. The gonads were not palpable, a chorda was present, and the phallus measured 2x1 cm on the dorsal and 1.6x1 cm on the ventral side. The baby is currently still in the neonatal intensive care unit and requires mechanical respiratory support. On postnatal day 30, we checked the baby's hormone levels. The 17-hydroxy progesterone (17OHP) was 41 ng/mL, which is slightly above the normal limits of 35.5 ng/mL. The DHEA sulphate (DHEASO4) was 1500 µg/dL, much higher than the normal range of 123-882 µg/dL. The testosterone level was also elevated, at 2.94 ng/mL, compared to the normal limits of 0.05-0.16 ng/mL. The FSH level was 1.3 IU/L.
Mother: Oh, I see. What does all this mean for my baby?
Doctor: These hormonal imbalances may be related to the baby's genital appearance and the presence of a uterus. We will need to continue monitoring the baby closely and provide appropriate treatment as needed. It's important to keep a close eye on the baby's health and development, and we will need to schedule regular follow-up appointments with the pediatric endocrinology team.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 72-year old female melanoma patient in disease stage IV (pT2a, N3c, M1d; AJCC 2017). Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Well, I have this bulky ulcerated tumor mass on my right upper leg, and I've been told that I have an asymptomatic singular brain metastasis, and some other suspected tumor lesions in my chest, iliac, inguinal, and lung areas.
Doctor: I see. We've also found that your serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated at 566 U/l, which is above the normal range of 135–214 U/l, and your S100B level is at 0.63 μg/l, which is higher than the normal level of < 0.2 μg/l. The BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutation analysis showed gene wild-types. Based on the tumor board recommendation, we will initiate ipilimumab (3 mg/kg body weight) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg body weight) combination therapy. This treatment is approved by the FDA for patients with BRAF V600 wild-type, unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
Patient: Oh, okay. What else is planned in terms of treatment?
Doctor: We're also planning radiotherapy for the brain lesion (stereotactic) and the bulky mass on your right upper leg. Before starting the treatment, we found that you had normal blood leucocytes and a mild C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation.
Patient: Hmm, got it. But you know, two days after starting the immunotherapy, my leg pain worsened. Is that normal?
Doctor: It's important that you mentioned that. When you came in with the worsened pain on your right upper leg, we ran some blood tests. You were in good condition without a history of chills, fever, weight loss, or malaise. However, the blood tests showed a massive leucocytosis (68,970/μl; normal range: 4,600–9,500/μl) with neutrophilia (63,420/μl; normal range: 1,800–7,200/μl). Your CRP was also elevated at 53 mg/l, which is above the normal level of < 0.5 mg/l.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What does that mean?
Doctor: We took wound swabs from the ulcerated tumor on your right upper leg and found Staphylococcus aureus. To treat this, we have administered intravenously 600 clindamycine 3 times daily over 10 days.
Patient: Alright, and what about the blood smears?
Doctor: We checked the blood smears, and they do not reveal signs of leukemia, which is good news. We'll continue to monitor your condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

"Doctor: Hello! I understand that you've been referred to our Department from the National Organ Procurement and Transplant Network waiting list for a kidney transplant. How have you been feeling lately?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been feeling alright, I guess. Just dealing with my hypertension and taking medication for it.
Doctor: I see. Are you currently married?
Patient: No, I'm not. I'm an unmarried office worker.
Doctor: Have you ever had any abdominal surgery?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: As per your records, you have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), but you're not currently requiring hemodialysis, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your pretransplant estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 13.7 mL/minute per 1.73 m2, and your body mass index is 21.9 kg/m2. During your physical examination, we noticed an asymptomatic bilateral flank mass. Have you experienced any discomfort or pain from this mass?
Patient: No, I haven't felt any pain or discomfort.
Doctor: We performed an abdominal MRI scan, which confirmed the presence of multiple cysts of different diameters within your significantly enlarged native kidneys. Their sagittal diameter is greater than 25 cm bilaterally. However, we don't anticipate any space constraints at the putative transplantation site in your right iliac fossa, so there's no need for a nephrectomy before the transplant.
Patient: Oh, that's good to know.
Doctor: The donor for your kidney transplant is a 50-year-old Asian male, who unfortunately passed away in a motor vehicle accident. He had no significant comorbidities. A CT scan showed a single renal artery and vein.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: The surgical technique for abdominal organ procurement followed established principles. The right kidney has been assigned to our institution for your transplant.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: After a multidisciplinary board discussion and obtaining your informed consent, you'll be scheduled for robotic-assisted kidney transplantation (RAKT).
Patient: Okay, thank you.
Doctor: The RAKT will be performed using the da Vinci Xi Robot® in a four-arm configuration with a 0° lens. You'll be in a 30° Trendelenburg position during the procedure. The surgical technique will follow the principles of the Vattikuti–Medanta technique with specific modifications tailored to your anatomy.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you have a complicated cardiac history. Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient: Yes, I've been having limiting angina for quite some time now.
Doctor: I see that you are on maximally titrated medical therapy, including aspirin, prasugrel, carvedilol, ranolazine, isosorbidemononitrate (sustained release), atorvastatin, lisinopril, nitroglycerin patch, and as needed sublingual nitroglycerin. You have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: And you had a coronary artery bypass graft 15 years ago, with reverse saphenous vein graft to first and second obtuse marginal arteries, and another to the posterior descending artery and posterolateral artery, is that right?
Patient: Yes, and I also had a redo CABG 2 years ago, with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD).
Doctor: I see that you also have a history of multiple stents and prior bilateral carotid endarterectomy. About 8 months ago, you were evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery, and they recommended against reoperation, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: About 4 months ago, you underwent another coronary angiography. The angiogram showed a relatively long 95% stenosis in the mid-LAD, extending from the mid-LAD to a bit passed the LIMA anastomosis, with retrograde flow into the LIMA. There was also some tenting of the LAD at the anastomotic site. Do you remember this?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: Several predilations were performed at 8 and 10 atmospheres, but there was no significant improvement to the stenosis. They then deployed a 2.25 × 28 mm Synergy drug-eluting stent (Boston Scientific) at 12 atmospheres and postdilated with a 2.25 × 20 mm noncompliant balloon at 14 atmospheres. The stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD with no residual stenosis. However, a slight kink in the distal one-third of the stent at the LIMA insertion point was noted. Do you recall this as well?
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: The movement of the intact stent during diastole and systole was also observed.

"Doctor: Hello, we have a 60-year-old white British female patient here who was admitted to the hospital with unilateral ankle pain and swelling, stage-3 acute kidney injury (AKI), and haematuria. Was this you?
Patient: Yes, that's me. I had recently been discharged from the hospital after being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and AKI.
Doctor: I see. On admission, we initially treated you with IV fluids and started you on oral Prednisolone at 25 mg daily. Our Rheumatology team suspected a flare-up of your known rheumatoid arthritis. A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was ruled out on a venous ultrasound-Doppler. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that sounds right.
Doctor: We also conducted extensive investigations to diagnose the aetiology of the AKI. You were started on a broad-spectrum antibiotic, Tazobactam + Piperacillin, due to a positive urine dip and microscopy. The urine culture later grew Glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus sp., and based on microbiologist advice, we initiated Daptomycin at 4 mg/Kg. We discontinued Prednisolone the day before. Do you remember that?
Patient: Yes, I do.
Doctor: Unfortunately, within fifty minutes of receiving the first dose of Daptomycin, you suffered from two tonic-clonic seizures which were five minutes apart. These lasted approximately two minutes each and both terminated spontaneously. How are you feeling now?
Patient: Hmm, I'm feeling better now, thanks.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We conducted a further neurological examination and found no focal deficit. You also experienced a single, further, generalised seizure 2 hours later for a few minutes, but no others were observed afterward. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: On that day, your mean arterial pressure was 130 mmHg, and your oxygen saturations ranged between 94 and 97%. We also recorded your elevated BP for the preceding week. Your haemoglobin was 105g/l, urea was 13.8 mmol/L, creatinine was 228 micromol/L, eGFR by MDRD was 19ml/min, and C-reactive protein was 14 i.u.

Patient: Yes, I've been taking klopidogrel, ramipril, amlodipin, atorvastatin, gliclazide, and metformin for a prolonged period of time.
Doctor: Okay, thank you. After conducting a fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, we found that you have a ciliary artery occlusion in your left eye, resulting in a visual acuity of 20/200. Your right eye has an occult choroidal neovascular membrane with subretinal fluid. We performed three monthly intravitreal RAN injections to treat it. Have you noticed any improvement in your vision since the treatments?
Patient: Yes, after the third injection, my vision improved from 20/32 to 20/25.
Doctor: That's good to hear. We also observed a decrease in your central macular thickness. However, I understand that you've been experiencing a generalized, excessively pruriginous skin eruption on your trunk, lumbar region, and extensor aspects of your upper and lower extremities. Did these eruptions worsen after the third injection?
Patient: Yes, the lesions got worse after the third injection.
Doctor: I see. We conducted laboratory examinations, which showed mild hyperlipidemia with cholesterol at 241 mg/dl and triglycerides at 256 mg/dl. Your blood glucose level was 155 mg/dl, and your HbA1C was 6.6%. In the dermatological examination, we found a generalized, erythematous rash with umblicated papules, many of which had ridge-like borders, and some containing keratin plugs. We also performed a skin biopsy.
Patient: What did the skin biopsy show?
Doctor: The biopsy demonstrated a cup-shaped depression of the epidermis associated with a keratin plug containing compact ortho- and parakeratosis with granular nuclear debris. Altered collagen fibers were seen in the underlying dermis, with focal extrusion through the epidermis. Based on these clinical and histological findings, you were diagnosed with acquired reactive perforating collagenosis (ARPC).
Patient: Was this caused by the injections?
Doctor: Yes, we performed a challenge test, which indicated that the rash and pruritus started after the injections. Unfortunately, you had a poor response to topical steroids to treat the rash.
Patient: What's the next step for treatment?
Doctor: We will proceed with 22 sessions of NBUVB therapy to help alleviate your symptoms.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented with a history of right knee pain for a 3-month duration. Can you tell me if you've experienced any trauma or undue exercise recently?
Patient: No, I haven't had any trauma or done any excessive exercise.
Doctor: Alright, let me do a physical examination. I've noticed joint effusion and a limited range of motion in your right knee. Have you experienced any locking in the joint or felt a palpable mass?
Patient: No, there's no locking or any mass that I can feel.
Doctor: And do you have any other significant past history that I should be aware of?
Patient: No, I don't have any other significant past history.
Doctor: I see that you haven't received any conservative treatments or plain x-radiography. Based on an MRI of your right knee, there's an intra-articular lesion located around the posterior cruciate ligament. The lesion shows iso-intensity or lower intensity compared to surrounding muscle in T1 weighted MRIs, and high signal intensity in T2 weighted MRIs (Fig. ). The preoperative differential diagnoses could be synovial chondromatosis, pigmented villonodular synovitis, or malignant soft tissue tumour.
Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, then?
Doctor: We're planning to perform an arthroscopy operation to remove the lesion and obtain a biopsy to test for malignant soft tissue tumour. If it's positive for malignancy, additional wide extra-articular resection would be needed, and artificial joints were prepared.
Patient: Alright, what happened during the arthroscopy?
Doctor: During the arthroscopy of your right knee, we found synovial hyperplasia inflammation and the mass in front of the right posterior cruciate ligament (Fig. ). We excised the lesion and performed a partial synovectomy.
Patient: What were the findings of the biopsy?
Doctor: Macroscopically, the right knee mass was a piece of grey-red tissue measuring 2.5 cm by 2 cm by 1 cm in size. The antibodies, clones, dilutions, pretreatment conditions, and sources are listed in Table . On microscopic examination (Fig. ), the tumour consisted of a bland fibroblastic proliferation arranged in irregular fasciitis with tissue-culture-like appearance. The stroma varied from focally myxoid with microcyst formation to collagenous. Extravasated erythrocytes and small lymphocytes were present throughout the lesion. No areas of necrosis or atypical mitosis were seen.
Patient: What about the immunohistochemistry results?
Doctor: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the cells were positive in patches for SMA and negative for S100, desmin, CK(AE1/AE3), and nuclear (Fig. ).
Patient: So, what does all this mean for me?
Doctor: Based on these findings, it appears that the lesion is not malignant, which is good news. We will continue to monitor your recovery and let you know if any additional treatments or follow-ups are needed. Be sure to report any changes in your symptoms or new concerns.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient, with a 3-month history of right knee pain, presents with joint effusion and a limited range of motion in the right knee.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 36-year-old woman with a weight of 50 kg and a height of 147 cm. You've been diagnosed with CIPA and are scheduled for revision of your left total hip arthroplasty. Can you tell me about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, ever since I was born, I've had recurrent episodes of unexplained fever, anhidrosis, burns, and bone fractures.
Doctor: I see. You've also previously undergone 7 operations for spinal deformity and 1 operation of total hip arthroplasty on both sides, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Although you lack general diaphoresis and thermal nociception, you mentioned that you perform body surface cooling at your own discretion when you feel at risk of hyperthermia, and your body temperature is kept approximately at 36°C?
Patient: Yeah, I do that to prevent overheating.
Doctor: Good to know. We didn't observe any signs of mental retardation or orthostatic hypotension. Also, no abnormalities were detected on your chest radiographs and electrocardiograms. Your blood biochemistry showed no abnormality except mild anemia, indicated by a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dl.
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: No premedication was administered before your surgery. After you were brought into the operating room, we started routine monitoring and measurement of the bispectral index (BIS). Your body temperature was measured at the urinary bladder, esophagus, and precordial skin and controlled by a hot-air-type heater.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: We administered Propofol at an effect-site concentration of 4 μg/ml by target-controlled infusion. After muscle relaxation was achieved by the administration of 50 mg of rocuronium, your trachea was intubated.
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: Immediately after endotracheal intubation, your systolic blood pressure increased from 130 to 145 mmHg, and your heart rate increased from 60 to 95 beats per minute (bpm). Two minutes later, your systolic blood pressure had decreased to 125 mmHg. Propofol was continuously infused intravenously at a target concentration of 2 to 4 μg/ml, and BIS levels were maintained between 40 and 60.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: After an arterial catheter was placed, your position was changed from the supine to the right lateral position. Surgery was then started.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: Since no circulatory change associated with pain occurred during surgery, opioids were not administered. Regarding hemodynamics, everything was stable throughout the procedure.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Yes, the surgery went well. Please make sure to follow up with us for any post-operative concerns or further treatment. Do you have any questions?
Patient: No, I think you covered everything. Thank you, Doctor.

"Doctor: Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. Can you please tell me what brought you to the emergency department today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I had a seizure at home, and my mom called an ambulance. It was my first time having a seizure.
Doctor: I see. You arrived about 15 minutes after the seizure, correct?
Patient: Yeah, that's right.
Doctor: When you arrived, you were somnolent, arousable, and confused, which is consistent with a postictal state after a seizure. Can you tell me if you've been feeling unwell recently?
Patient: Yeah, for the past two to three days, I've been feeling sick. I had upper respiratory infection symptoms, like cough and nasal congestion.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. Your mother mentioned that she heard a ""thud"" and found you on the floor shaking and incontinent of your bladder and bowels. She said the shaking lasted about one to two minutes. Can you confirm that?
Patient: I don't remember it clearly, but that's what my mom told me.
Doctor: Your mother also reported that you've had a decreased appetite recently and that you're usually a picky eater with a very limited diet. She said you've only eaten French fries since becoming sick. She's been encouraging you to drink Gatorade and Pedialyte for hydration. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's true.
Doctor: Let's talk about your medical history. You have no significant past medical history, no surgeries or hospitalizations, and an allergy to amoxicillin that causes hives. You see a pediatrician regularly and are up to date on vaccines. You don't take any medications on a daily basis. Is that accurate?
Patient: Yes, that's all correct.
Doctor: Your family history indicates hypertension, but no family history of seizure disorders. You live in a house, and your mother says you feel safe at home. No one else in the home has been ill recently. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: When you arrived, we took your vital signs. Your oral temperature was 38° Celsius, heart rate 108 beats per minute, blood pressure 111/70 millimeters of mercury, breathing rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygenating at 97% on room air. On the initial physical exam, you appeared drowsy but overall well developed. We will continue to monitor you and run some tests to determine the cause of the seizure.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I'm a 65-year-old man and I've been experiencing reduced vision in both my eyes lately.
Doctor: I see. Can you tell me about your medical history? Have you had any conditions or treatments in the past?
Patient: Yes, I was treated for small cell cancer of the lung and had chemotherapy for it. Seven months ago, I had breathlessness and a pleural effusion was found during a routine examination. They also discovered a mycobacterial infection in the pleura.
Doctor: It looks like you were treated with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and INH for the mycobacterial infection. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. But I had drug-induced hepatitis, so they changed my regimen to rifampicin and ethambutol with the addition of levofloxacin.
Doctor: Alright, let's start by examining your eyes. First, we'll check your best-corrected visual acuity, which is 6/15 in both eyes. Your extraocular movements and anterior segment examination seem normal. Now, I'll perform a dilated fundus examination. That looks normal as well.
Patient: So, what could be causing my reduced vision?
Doctor: Let's conduct a visual-evoked potential (VEP) test to get a better understanding of your condition. The VEP results show reduced amplitude and prolonged latency in both eyes, suggestive of bilateral optic axonopathy.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means there might be some damage to the optic nerves in both your eyes. To further investigate this, we'll need to do an MRI scan.
Patient: Okay, what did the MRI scan show?
Doctor: The MRI scan revealed multiple round peripherally enhancing lesions in both cerebral hemispheres and in the right cerebellum. Moreover, Central 30-2 perimetry revealed an incomplete left homonymous hemianopia with additional inferior temporal defects in the right eye.
Patient: Is it related to the medications I've been taking?
Doctor: Yes, based on these findings, it seems that ethambutol toxicity is the likely cause of your reduced vision, as the lesions in the cerebral hemispheres are not consistent with the perimetric findings.
Patient: What should I do now? Are there any treatment options?
Doctor: There are treatments available, but it's important to discuss them with your primary care physician and consider discontinuing ethambutol. However, I must let you know that the decision to proceed with any treatment is ultimately up to you.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll think about it and let you know if I decide to go ahead with the treatment.

Patient: Hi, doctor. For the past week, I've been experiencing fever, chills, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, and progressive shortness of breath. My diarrhea is watery and nonbloody, and I've had about four episodes a day.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any chest pain, leg swelling, weakness, headache, or dizziness recently?
Patient: No, I haven't.
Doctor: Did anyone around you have a similar illness recently?
Patient: Well, my son had an unspecified illness recently, but it has resolved now. Other than that, no one else was sick.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. Based on your vitals, you're currently febrile with a temperature of 102.0°F, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 82/56 mmHg, and tachycardic at a rate of 149 bpm. Your physical exam showed cervical lymphadenopathy as well. We have also conducted some laboratory tests.
Patient: What did the tests show?
Doctor: Your lab results revealed segmented neutrophil predominant leukocytosis, elevated levels of troponin (2.45 ng/ml), BNP (457.2 pg/ml), and d-dimer (6.72 µg/ml). Your Electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia with possible left atrial enlargement. Based on these findings, we have initiated Vasopressor support and an unfractionated heparin drip, and you have been admitted to the intensive care unit for further management.
Patient: I see. What about the imaging tests?
Doctor: Imaging tests showed a low-probability VQ scan for pulmonary embolism and severe diffuse myocardial hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20–25% without pericardial effusion. Your CT abdomen showed generalized lymphadenopathy and mild hepatosplenomegaly. However, your chest X-ray was negative for any acute pathology on admission.
Patient: Did you run any tests for autoimmune diseases?
Doctor: Yes, we performed a detailed rheumatologic workup, which was unremarkable. This included tests for antinuclear antibody (ANA), double-stranded DNA, antiproteinase 3, antimyeloperoxidase, and C3 and C4 levels.
Patient: What's the next step in my treatment?
Doctor: We performed a right heart catheterization, which demonstrated elevated wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular pressure. These findings are consistent with acute left ventricular failure and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. With a presumptive diagnosis, we will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment accordingly.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, Doc. I'm an HIV-1-infected 41-year-old male farmer. Recently, I've been experiencing right hypochondriac abdominal pain for about five days. Along with that, I have decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and yellowish discolouration of my sclera for the last two days.
Doctor: I see. Are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing, such as fever, diarrhoea, blurring of vision, or any difficulty or pain while swallowing?
Patient: No, I haven't had any fever, diarrhoea, blurring of vision, or odynophagia or dysphagia.
Doctor: Thank you for letting me know. I see that you first presented to us back in September 2016, when you were diagnosed with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonitis (PJP) on transbronchial lung biopsy. You were successfully treated with co-trimoxazole and prednisolone. The biopsy didn't reveal any CMV inclusion bodies at that time. Your CD4 count was 109/μL, and your HIV-1 viral load was 4.89 log copies/ml. 
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: You were initially diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in 2000 and treated by another physician. You were started on zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP), and then switched to tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF), 3TC, atazanavir, and ritonavir (ATV/r) in 2011 due to virological failure. After controlling your PJP, we switched your HAART to raltegravir (RAL), darunavir (DRV), and ritonavir based on the genotypic resistance report. 
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: So, within four weeks of initiating the new HAART regimen, you've presented with these current symptoms. Your physical examination showed icterus and tender hepatomegaly, but fundoscopy did not reveal any CMV retinitis. You have normocytic normochromic anaemia with a haemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dl, and your total leucocyte and differential counts are within normal range.
Patient: Okay, and what about my liver?
Doctor: Your liver enzymes are as follows: total bilirubin is 9.2 mg/dl (reference value: 0-1 mg/dl); aspartate transaminase (AST) is 109 U/L [15–37 U/L]; alanine transaminase (ALT) is 41 U/L (14–59 U/L); and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is 90 U/L. 
Patient: Hmm, so what does all this mean, Doc?
Doctor: These results indicate that you have elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, which could be contributing to your symptoms. We will need to investigate further to determine the cause and appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, please continue taking your current medications and report any new or worsening symptoms.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been referred to our service for further management of your recurrent germ cell malignancy. Can you tell me about your initial symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I first noticed some abdominal bloating and I was told there was an 18-cm mass in my adnexal area.
Doctor: That's correct. Your tumor marker elevation at that time showed Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) at 131.53 ng/mL, CA 125 at 521 U/mL, and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 242 IU/L. You underwent a fertility-sparing staging surgery which included a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, unilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, omentectomy, and cul-de-sac tumor excision. Then, you received chemotherapy with 4 cycles of BEP, which is bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Is that right?
Patient: Yes, that's right. I was 14 years old when all of that happened.
Doctor: The final pathology reported a mixed germ cell tumor, mainly composed of immature teratoma (grade 3, FIGO stage IIIC, pT3cN0M0) with components of embryonal carcinoma (23%) and yolk sac tumor (3%). Now, during your follow-up, disease recurrence was suspected due to tumor marker elevation again (AFP: 118.82 ng/mL, CA 125: 58.82 U/mL) and pelvic cystic lesions with ascites on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. That's why you were referred to us. Have you noticed any new symptoms lately?
Patient: I haven't noticed anything major, but I do feel some discomfort in my pelvic area occasionally.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. In order to address the recurrence, you underwent a second fertility-sparing debulking surgery at our hospital. The intra-operative findings showed a 6 × 5-cm solid tumor at your omentum, another gray tan soft tissue measuring 5 × 3 cm upon your bladder, and some small cul-de-sac tumors. There was no residual disease noted. Do you have any questions about the surgery?
Patient: No, I think I understand what happened. What were the results of the surgery?
Doctor: All the lesions were reported to be metastatic mixed germ cell tumors, mainly composed of an immature teratoma with focal areas of yolk sac tumors. The teratoma component is made up of squamous epithelium, intestinal-type epithelium, respiratory epithelium, mesenchymal tissue, and neuroglial tissue. The immature element is found focally and is composed of fetal-type epithelium and mesenchymal tissue. 
Patient: Oh, I see. What does this mean for my condition?
Doctor: It means that the surgery was successful in removing the recurrent tumors. We will continue to monitor your tumor markers and perform regular CT scans to ensure there is no further recurrence. It's important to keep an eye on your symptoms and report any changes or concerns to us.

Patient: I require a pedestal walker and long leg braces to ambulate.
Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your voice over the years?
Patient: My voice has been hoarse since I was 16, and I have documented vocal cord paralysis. I also develop shortness of breath after speaking for several minutes.
Doctor: I see. Let me conduct a neurological examination to better understand your condition. *After the examination* I found some weakness in your biceps and triceps muscles in your upper extremities and no movements in your intrinsic hand muscles, wrist extensors, or wrist flexors. In your lower extremities, there are trace movements of your hamstrings and no movements of your quadriceps, anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius, or intrinsic foot muscles.
Patient: Oh, that sounds bad...
Doctor: Your small fiber sensory modalities, like pin prick or light touch, are essentially normal, with only a mild decrease to pin prick on your right great toe. However, your large fiber sensory modalities are profoundly abnormal. You were unable to detect vibration with a Rydell tuning fork at your toes, ankles, knees, and fingers. Joint position was absent at your toes and left ankle, and reduced at both knees.
Patient: I had no idea it was that extensive.
Doctor: Your Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes were unobtainable, except for a markedly reduced axillar nerve CMAP. Based on these findings, your CMT Neuropathy score is in the severe range of 28 out of 36.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: This means that your condition is quite severe, and it's important to continue using your mobility aids and seek appropriate treatment and therapy to maintain your quality of life. I will provide you with some recommendations and resources to help you manage your symptoms.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.","S: The patient reports a history of mobility and balance difficulties since age 2 and 7 months.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I got this high voltage electrical burn on my scalp and I was treated with dressing for 10 days in another hospital. But now, I have a fever and an infected wound.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any history of immune compromise?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: Alright. We'll have to do a debridement of your scalp to remove the infected tissue. Unfortunately, even after the debridement, you may still have a sustained fever and raised counts.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: Two days after the debridement, we'll do a clinical examination. We might find hyphae over the wound margin and gangrenous changes over your scalp surrounding the wound.
Patient: That sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, this could be an invasive fungal infection called zygomycosis. We'll start you on an injection of amphotericin B and take you for a wide debridement. We'll also take a tissue biopsy for histopathology examination.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: During the procedure, we'll perform outer bony cortex chiseling with a high-speed diamond burr. The histopathology report will help us identify the specific fungus causing the infection, which in your case is A. corymbifera. Intravenous amphotericin B injection will be continued for a 4-week period since diagnosis to complete healing.
Patient: Okay, I understand.
Doctor: After two weeks of anti-fungal treatment, your clinical condition should improve. Once we confirm the absence of the fungal infection, we'll cover the scalp defect with a free anterior lateral thigh flap.
Patient: Oh, that's good news.
Doctor: Yes, the recipient vessels will be the superior temporal artery and vein. In the post-operative period, you'll continue to receive intravenous amphotericin B injection for 2 more weeks.
Patient: I see.
Doctor: The post-operative period should be uneventful, and your condition will improve over time. Just make sure to follow our instructions carefully and keep an eye on your symptoms.

"Doctor: Hello there, I see you have a history of hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. What brings you here today?
Patient: Well, I was admitted to the hospital after an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. I was treated with unfractionated heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
Doctor: I understand. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: On the fourth day, I developed acute shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. The doctors did a DVT and pulmonary embolism workup.
Doctor: And what did they find?
Patient: They found both a DVT and a subocclusive saddle-shaped pulmonary embolism. They started me on a continuous heparin infusion for treatment.
Doctor: I see. Did you experience any other symptoms after that?
Patient: Yes, the following day, I developed sudden left-sided weakness and rightward gaze deviation.
Doctor: That sounds concerning. It seems like you had an acute ischemic stroke. Did they perform any imaging tests to confirm this?
Patient: Yes, they did a CT angiogram of the head and neck and an MRI of my brain. They found that the stroke was caused by right-sided common carotid artery occlusion with thrombus extending into the external and internal carotid arteries.
Doctor: Did they find anything else on the imaging?
Patient: They also noted a tandem occlusion of the inferior branch of the right middle cerebral artery on cerebral angiography.
Doctor: So, what was the next step in your treatment?
Patient: The doctors performed a successful mechanical thrombectomy of the right carotid artery bifurcation thrombus.
Doctor: That's great to hear. How did your platelet count look after the procedure?
Patient: My platelet count dropped from 153,000/µL to 94,000/µL, which raised suspicion for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. They stopped the heparin infusion and started me on continuous bivalirudin infusion instead.
Doctor: Did they perform any additional tests to confirm the suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia?
Patient: Yes, they sent PF4-H AB and SRA tests.
Doctor: What were the results of those tests?
Patient: The tests came back negative, and my platelet count started to uptrend to 105,000/µL.
Doctor: That's good news. Since the tests were negative, what was their next step?
Patient: They stopped the bivalirudin infusion and restarted me on therapeutic continuous heparin infusion due to reduced suspicion of HIT.
Doctor: Did they perform any other tests during your stay at the hospital?
Patient: Yes, they did a transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study, which revealed a patent foramen ovale with right to left shunting. They think the cause of my stroke was a paradoxical embolism.
Doctor: I see. How has your platelet count been since then?
Patient: From day 8, my platelets started to downtrend to 36,000/µL.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing your experience.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've presented with a history of macrocephaly and ataxia. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble with my balance and coordination for about six weeks now.
Doctor: Hmm, I see. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm losing some vision on the sides.
Doctor: We performed an eye examination and although there wasn't any papilledema, it was suspicious for mild peripheral loss of vision. Were there any issues in your past medical history?
Patient: No, I've been healthy and developing normally.
Doctor: Alright. At presentation, you did not have diencephalic syndrome. We conducted a brain MRI which demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass, centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm, measuring 5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm. This mass has some effect on the midbrain and third ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is a serious condition. We performed an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to manage your hydrocephalus. The pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma. It was BRAF-V600E negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing.
Patient: What does that mean for my treatment?
Doctor: We started you on chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin. Unfortunately, your tumor showed rapid progression with worsening hydrocephalus six weeks into chemotherapy.
Patient: Oh, that's not good.
Doctor: No, it's not. Due to the progression, you developed further complications like progressive right-sided hemiparesis, bitemporal hemianopia, central hypothyroidism, and feeding difficulties requiring a gastrostomy tube and placement of a second VP shunt.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: After extensive discussions and mutual expert consensus, we decided to stop your chemotherapy and start you on a novel targeted agent called dabrafenib at 5.25mg/kg/day. Three months into dabrafenib, your tumor size decreased by more than 70% to 2.5cm x 3.5cm x 2.7cm, with continued decline until plateauing after two years of therapy.
Patient: Wow, that's great news!
Doctor: Yes, it is. Prior to dabrafenib, you had marked motor and speech impairments, but now you're able to perform all age-appropriate developmental skills independently.
Patient: That's amazing!
Doctor: Indeed, and you no longer require the gastrostomy tube. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as needed.

"Doctor: Hi there, I see you've been referred to Clinical Genetics for an evaluation of your son's history of developmental delay. Can you tell me more about the symptoms he's been experiencing?
Patient's mother: Yes, he is our second child, and his development has been slower than usual. He began to walk and speak at 14 months of age, but he still doesn't know the alphabet, colors, or numbers.
Doctor: I understand. It's important to note that your family's pedigree is remarkable as your maternal male first cousin also required special education for learning disabilities. Regarding your son's prenatal history, you had a chlamydia infection at 3 months gestational age, is that correct?
Patient's mother: Yes, that's correct. I was treated with antibiotics for the infection.
Doctor: Your son was born vaginally at 37 weeks gestational age, weighing 1.98 kg, and spent a total of 23 days in the NICU requiring nasogastric feeds and phototherapy. Is that accurate?
Patient's mother: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: Your son was diagnosed with global developmental delay by a behavioral pediatrician and began early intervention services at 2 years of age, receiving occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Currently, he is in special education classes and is getting speech and occupational therapies. Can he understand directions and point to body parts?
Patient's mother: Yes, he can do that.
Doctor: In addition to these developmental delays, your son has a history of anemia, which is followed by his pediatrician. On physical exam, we found that he has a low anterior hairline, slightly downward slanting palpebral fissures, infraorbital puffiness, overfolded helices bilaterally, a broad nasal bridge, a wide grin, and a thin upper lip, which generally resembled your facial features.
Patient's mother: Yes, I've noticed those similarities too.
Doctor: We performed Clinical Fragile X testing on your son's DNA, and it came back normal with 29 CGG repeats. However, CMA testing using the SurePrint G3 ISCA CGH + SNP 4 × 180 microarray detected a heterozygous 1.21 Mb deletion of chromosome 3q29.
Patient's mother: What does that mean for my son?
Doctor: This genetic finding could be related to his developmental delays and other symptoms. We will need to continue monitoring his progress and providing the appropriate therapies to help him overcome these challenges.
Patient's mother: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. What are the next steps for my son's care?
Doctor: We will continue to work closely with his pediatrician and therapists to ensure he receives the appropriate support, and we will schedule regular follow-up appointments with our genetics team to monitor his progress.
Patient's mother: I appreciate your help, doctor. We will do everything we can to support our son.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I came to the emergency department because I've been having persistent hematochezia, lower abdominal pain, and nonbloody emesis for a month now. I've had intermittent rectal bleeding for years, but never continuously for a whole month.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any fevers, weight changes, or taken any antibiotics recently? And have you had a colonoscopy before?
Patient: No, I haven't had any fevers or weight changes, and I haven't taken antibiotics. I've never had a colonoscopy before.
Doctor: Alright. I also need to know your past medical history. Do you have any conditions that we should be aware of?
Patient: Yes, I have moderate Hemophilia A with factor activity between 1 and 5 percent. I was prescribed Recombinant human factor VIII, but I haven't been very good with my visits.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important to follow up with your prescribed treatment. Now, when your rectal bleeding increased, were you told to take your Recombinant human factor VIII at a specific dose?
Patient: Yes, I was told to take 4000 units every 12 hours on days with heavy bleeding.
Doctor: Okay. During your examination, we noted tachycardia, tenderness to palpation in your lower abdomen, and positive fecal occult blood testing. We also conducted laboratory tests, which showed your hemoglobin at 11 g/dL and PT/PTT/INR values within normal limits. Your C reactive protein was elevated at 57.8 mg/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 21 mm/hr, and albumin at 3.5 g/dL.
Patient: Oh, wow! That sounds concerning.
Doctor: We also performed CT imaging of your abdomen and pelvis, which revealed abnormal colonic thickening. After administering Recombinant human factor VIII infusions without resolution of your symptoms, we decided to perform a colonoscopy and biopsies.
Patient: What did the biopsies show?
Doctor: The biopsies confirmed that you have chronic active ulcerative colitis. We started you on empiric therapy for inflammatory bowel disease and eventually had to give you high-dose intravenous steroids before you showed clinical improvement.
Patient: What kind of steroids and other medications did you give me?
Doctor: You were given intravenous methyl prednisolone 40 mg every six hours for the first six days, followed by 60 mg daily intravenously until your discharge. Additionally, you received budesonide 9 mg orally once daily for the first six days, mesalamine 800 mg orally three times a day for the first six days, and pantoprazole 40 mg orally for your entire 14-day inpatient stay. We also prescribed metronidazole 500 mg intravenously once daily for the first six days and then orally every eight hours until discharge.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you're here for a dermatological evaluation today. Can you please tell me what concerns you have about your skin?
Patient: Yeah, I have this brown papule on my upper back, and it's within a large tattoo. I'm not really sure how long it's been there or if it was there when I got the tattoo.
Doctor: I see. Let me take a closer look. Hmm, it appears to be an 8-millimeter flat, brown papule. Since we're uncertain about the lesion's initial presentation, pattern of growth, and appearance, I would recommend a shave removal of the lesion to examine it further. How does that sound?
Patient: Okay, I guess that sounds fine.
[After the shave removal and excision]
Doctor: We have examined the original excision, and it showed an atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation. The dermis also contained scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis. It's important to note that an early evolving melanoma in situ couldn't be excluded at that time.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Don't worry, we took further action by re-excising the lesion with a 5-millimeter margin. Upon examination, no residual melanocytic lesion was detected, only scar tissue was present. This is a positive sign.
Patient: That's a relief. So what's next?
Doctor: You have healed well since the excision, and we will continue to monitor your skin to ensure there are no further concerns. It's important to keep an eye on any changes in your skin and report them to us.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I presented to the emergency department because I've been experiencing extreme breathlessness and profuse diaphoresis within the last 2 hours.
Doctor: I see. Let's start with a physical examination. *After the examination* Your blood pressure is increased, and your oxygen saturation is low. I also noticed some bilateral basal pulmonary end-inspiratory rales upon auscultation of your chest.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We'll need to perform an electrocardiography (ECG) to check for any myocardial injury pattern. *After the ECG* The ECG results do not demonstrate an acute myocardial injury pattern, which is a good sign.
Patient: That's a relief.
Doctor: We also took a chest radiography, which showed bilateral diffuse infiltrations, Kerley B lines, and flow inversion. Furthermore, we tested your cardiac serum markers (high-sensitivity troponin I using Architect STAT assay by Abbott Diagnostics) and performed a D-dimer test, both of which came back negative.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: We also conducted an echocardiographic assessment which disclosed mild concentric hypertrophy, mildly impaired left ventricular systolic function without regional wall motion abnormalities, and moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressure. Based on all this information, we have diagnosed you with acute pulmonary edema.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?
Doctor: It means fluid has built up in your lungs, making it difficult for you to breathe. We will need to hospitalize you under closed monitoring in the intensive care unit to treat this condition.
Patient: Alright.
Doctor: We will administer furosemide and glyceryl trinitrate intravenously and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor orally, in combination with oxygen support. This should help subside your acute heart failure symptoms.
Patient: How long will it take for me to recover?
Doctor: Complete respiratory recovery should occur in approximately 12 hours. During the second day of hospitalization, we will perform another ECG to check for any T-wave inversion. If needed, you will also undergo coronary angiography to rule out significant coronary artery disease.
Patient: I understand.
Doctor: Keep in mind that there are other possible causes of T-wave inversion, such as myocardial ischemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, massive pulmonary embolism, pheochromocytoma, cocaine abuse, status epilepticus, gastrointestinal emergencies like perforated ulcer, acute pancreatitis, and acute cholecystitis, cardiac sarcoidosis, electroconvulsive therapy, and cardiac memory T-wave pattern.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've been experiencing some issues with my left eye. I noticed a thickening of the iris, and it's been bothering me.
Doctor: I see. Let's perform a gonioscopy to take a closer look at the root of the iris in your left eye. 
(After performing the gonioscopy)
Doctor: The gonioscopy revealed a pigmented fusiform thickening of the iris root in your left eye. We also did an ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) which showed the presence of a well-circumscribed dome-shaped mass at the level of the ciliary body, between the 2:30 and 3 o'clock positions. The lesion is 8.18 mm large, 7.74 mm long, and 4.88 mm thick. It appears to be a melanoma of the ciliary body, involving the adjacent iris root.
Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What's the next step?
Doctor: In July 2008, you underwent brachytherapy using 106Ru. You received 100 Gy at the apex, with a dose rate of 79.09 cGy/hr, and a total rate at the sclera of 531.1 Gy, with a dose rate of 420.1 cGy/hr.
Patient: Okay, I remember that treatment. Did it help?
Doctor: One year later, you showed some scleral thinning and a prolapse of uveal tissue at the limbus, corresponding to the site of the preexisting lesion. UBM showed a local scleral extension of the tumor under the conjunctival layer, 0.88 mm thick. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20.
Patient: So, what was the next step?
Doctor: The patient underwent a radical block excision of the sclera, ciliary melanoma, and adjacent iris tissue. This was done by performing a peripheral iridectomy through the opening of the sclera, combined with a corneal tectonic graft, 8.50 mm large. We used 16 single stitches to close the wound.
Patient: I remember that surgery. Did it remove the melanoma completely?
Doctor: Histological analysis of the removed tissue confirmed the diagnosis of spindle cell melanoma. We will continue to monitor your condition and follow up with any necessary treatments or interventions.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi doctor, I've been having this itchy eruption on my neck and upper back for about 3 months now.
Doctor: I see. Have you identified any triggers or noticed any changes in your health during this time?
Patient: No, I haven't identified any triggers and I've been otherwise healthy.
Doctor: Alright. Based on your description and the clinical features, it seems that you, along with some other patients, have erythematous papules that form plaques arranged in a reticular pattern, which is more prominent peripherally. Other patients also had vesicles and minimal erosions, with lesions symmetrically distributed, mainly on the trunk. Have you noticed any other affected areas on your body?
Patient: Hmm, I think the lateral and posterior aspects of my neck are also affected.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for the information. A clinical diagnosis of PP was suspected in some patients with similar symptoms. We've conducted histological findings, and the differential diagnoses include impetiginized spongiotic dermatitis, pityriasis lichenoides, and viral exanthem. Periodic acid-Schiff stain was performed and came back negative for all specimens. Direct immunofluorescence was also performed for some patients and was negative as well.
Patient: Oh, I see. So, what can be done for this condition?
Doctor: The good news is that all patients eventually experienced a complete resolution of their lesions. Patient 1 was treated with superpotent topical corticosteroids prior to presentation to our department, but there was no improvement and new lesions continued to emerge. However, the patient reported gradual spontaneous resolution 10 weeks after the onset of the eruption, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.
Patient: What about other treatments?
Doctor: Patient 2 was previously treated with moderately potent topical corticosteroids and antihistamines, but again, there was no improvement and new lesions continued to emerge. Once doxycycline was initiated, the lesions cleared within a few weeks.
Patient: So, what do you recommend for me, doctor?
Doctor: Considering the past treatments and outcomes, I would recommend trying doxycycline to see if it helps clear the lesions. If there's no improvement, we can reassess and consider other options.

Patient: Hi, I came to the emergency department because I've been having severe lower abdominal pain and nausea for the past day.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me about your medical history?
Patient: I had a pelvic exenteration and a permanent end colostomy for stage IIIb cervical cancer. About two years later, I developed a parastomal hernia.
Doctor: I see. On this admission, you were diagnosed with an incarcerated parastomal hernia. We performed an emergency laparotomy, resecting more than one-and-a-half meters of gangrenous bowel and re-fashioning the stoma. A surgical mesh was applied with primary closure. The surgery was successful, and you were transferred to the ICU for monitoring.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: About a week later, you became pyrexial and didn't respond well to treatment. CT imaging showed a five-centimeter collection over the mesh. We then opened and explored the wound in the ICU and completed debridement.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: The wound dimensions were initially 20 cm x 23 cm x 5 cm, exposing the rectus sheath. To ensure healing, we used the VeraFlo™ Vacuum with instillation dressing at -125 mmHg. We cycled a sterile saline solution for three hours before applying the vacuum.
Patient: Yes, I remember that.
Doctor: We changed the dressing three times a week. Before each replacement, we soaked the dressing in saline solution for 20 minutes. After seven weeks, the wound reduced to 9 cm x 5 cm x 1.6 cm.
Patient: That's great to hear.
Doctor: Yes, there was also a significant decrease in the amount of exudate and debris, which resulted in a decreased instillation volume during that time.
Patient: Okay, good.
Doctor: I'm pleased to report that you mentioned improved pain control compared to the post-operative period. How are you feeling now?
Patient: Much better, thank you! The pain is much more manageable now.
Doctor: That's great to hear. We'll continue to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment as needed. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and support.","S: The patient reports severe lower abdominal pain and nausea for the past day.

"Doctor: Hello, I have your medical history here, and it says you've had migraine headaches for over 10 years. How have you been managing them?
Patient: Yeah, that's right. I've been using analgesic treatment, and it usually helps. But the headaches get worse when I do physical exercise.
Doctor: I see. Now, I understand that you sought medical attention due to sudden and intense headaches in the occipital region with no evident cause. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. They were different from my usual migraines.
Doctor: Okay. We did an emergency computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed the presence of a right occipital intracerebral hematoma. You were hospitalized and treated for a month until the clot resolved. How have you been feeling since then?
Patient: I was symptom-free for about a year, but then I started having a mild to moderate oppressive headache in the right temporal region. It improved with analgesics for about 15 days.
Doctor: And what happened after that?
Patient: The oppressive headache came back, but this time it was more intense hemicrania. I also experienced fatigue, short episodes of altered consciousness, sweating, projectile vomiting, and blurred vision in my left eye.
Doctor: I see. We performed a general physical and neurological exam, which did not show any positive data. We also looked for any evidence of triggering events like traumatic brain injury, hematologic disorders, previous surgeries, or infections of the central nervous system (CNS). We couldn't find any. Have you noticed any mood changes lately?
Patient: Yeah, I've been really irritable, aggressive, and anxious. I also have trouble thinking and concentrating, and I get disoriented about time and space.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. We performed a second CT-scan during the follow-up period. Now, let's discuss the results of your laboratory tests. Your hemoglobin is 133 g/L; leucocytes are 8.1 × 103, and platelets are 373 u/L. The coagulogram indicated suitable platelets, bleeding time of 1.30 s, coagulation time of 8 min, prothrombin time of 15.2 s (control 13 s ± 3), and activated thromboplastin time of 30 s. Your glycemia is 4.83 mmol/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is 42.51 U/L; glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GPT) is 42.29 U/L; cholesterol is 4.24 mmol/L; triglycerides are 0.90 mmol/L; and creatinin is 82.81 μmol. 
Patient: Okay, so what does all that mean?
Doctor: The results show that your blood counts and clotting factors are within normal ranges. Your blood sugar, liver enzymes, cholesterol, and triglycerides are also normal. We will continue monitoring your condition and work on finding the best treatment plan to manage your symptoms.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I've had this swelling on the right side of my cheek for about 6 months now. It's been getting bigger over time.
Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in the area?
Patient: No, not really. There hasn't been any pain at all.
Doctor: What about difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia? Have you noticed any issues with that?
Patient: No, I haven't had any trouble swallowing either.
Doctor: Alright, let's take a look. *After examining the patient* I can see a single, cystic swelling in your right cheek, around 2x2 cm2 with ill-defined margins. It's nontender and palpable bimanually. The rest of your oropharynx and laryngopharynx appear normal, and there are no palpable neck nodes. Your vitals and blood parameters are also stable.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: To better understand this swelling, we performed a cytological examination of the mass. It was reported as a chronic granulomatous lesion. We also did a CT scan of your head and neck, which revealed a well-defined cystic lesion measuring 2.6x21x19 mm3 in the right buccal space, arising from the buccinator muscle and displacing the zygomaticus major.
Patient: So what does all that mean?
Doctor: Based on these findings, we've made a provisional diagnosis of a right buccal cyst. We planned for an excision biopsy under general anesthesia and performed surgery with our team of ORL Head and Neck Surgeons.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: Intraoperatively, we found a well-defined cystic lesion measuring around 3x3 cm2 in the right buccal space. The cyst contained thick mucinous fluid. We sent the specimen for histopathological examination, and the findings were consistent with an oncocytoma.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: After the surgery, we kept you on intravenous antibiotics. The postoperative period was uneventful, with mild soft tissue swelling over the operated area without any collections. You were then discharged on the 7th postoperative day.
Patient: That's good to hear. How has my recovery been going?
Doctor: On your follow-up visit 1 week later, the swelling over the buccal region had subsided, and the intraoral surgical wound had healed. We followed up again after 3 months, and there were no signs of recurrence or disease progression.
Patient: That's a relief. Thank you for taking care of me, doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome! If you notice any changes or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!","S: The patient reports experiencing swelling on the right side of the cheek for about 6 months. The swelling has been growing over time.

"Doctor: Hi there, can you please tell me what brings you here today?
Patient: Well, I've had a history of intermittent, severe epigastric pain.
Doctor: I see. How long have you been experiencing this pain?
Patient: It's been happening for the past 5 months. The pain usually comes 15-30 minutes after every meal, but it's less severe and goes away on its own.
Doctor: Okay, let's review your test results. Your full blood count, serum biochemistry values, and C-reactive protein level are within normal ranges. Your arterial gas analysis is also normal. However, your abdominal plain radiography showed free air between the liver and diaphragm, and PI (Fig.). Additionally, abdominal computed tomography showed severe calcification of the SMA origin; SMA peripheral flow was reserved (Fig.). Computed tomography (CT) revealed bubble-like intramural gas of the small bowel with the contrasted wall pneumoperitoneum (Fig.).
Patient: Hmm, that sounds concerning. What does that all mean?
Doctor: Since you don't have peritonitis, we decided to take a conservative approach. We managed your condition in the intensive care unit due to potential risks of acute mesenteric ischemia from mesenteric artery occlusion or non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia. You were treated for bowel obstruction, which included fasting and intravenous fluid administration. You also received heparin infusion to prevent SMA occlusion and maintain collateral flow.
Patient: Yes, I remember that. I actually felt some relief from my abdominal pain during my stay in the ICU.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Seven days after admission, your abdominal plain radiography showed improvement in PI and pneumoperitoneum. So, we allowed you to start drinking fluids. Did you experience any pain after consuming fluids?
Patient: No, I didn't have any recurrent abdominal pain after drinking fluids.
Doctor: Great. Since there was no pain, we allowed you to eat solid food as well. Now, we had planned an angiography to further investigate and potentially relieve your postprandial abdominal pain. The findings showed severe stenosis of the SMA origin with calcification, and the SMA had replaced the common hepatic artery (Fig., ). We performed ET, namely stenting to the SMA and common hepatic artery.
Patient: How was the procedure done?
Doctor: We engaged the SMA trunk with a 6F Parent Plus 60 guiding catheter (Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) from your left brachial artery. Initially, we infused 8000 units of heparin, and added additional heparin to keep your activated whole blood clotting time over 200 seconds.
Patient: I see. So, what's next for me?
Doctor: Now that the procedure is done, we will continue to monitor your condition closely. It's essential to maintain a proper diet and follow up with your appointments regularly. If you notice any recurrence of abdominal pain or any new symptoms, please contact us immediately.
Patient: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I will follow your advice and keep an eye on my condition.","S: The patient reports intermittent, severe epigastric pain for the past 5 months.

"Doctor: Hi, I understand you've been evaluated for persistent hyponatremia, which has been going on for about a month. Can you tell me about any symptoms you've experienced during this duration?
Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired and confused lately. I also noticed some unexplained weight loss.
Doctor: Your physical exam didn't show any signs of volume overload or depletion, which is good. However, your workup revealed a sodium level of 126 mmol/l without other electrolyte abnormalities, serum osmolality of 260 mOsm/kg, serum uric acid level of 2.0 mg/dl, normal cortisol, normal TSH, urine sodium of 45 mmol/l, and urine osmolality of 274 mOsm/kg. These findings are consistent with a condition called SIADH. You were taking Citalopram, which we thought might have been the cause, so we stopped it. However, your hyponatremia persisted, so we did some more tests, especially considering your extensive smoking history.
Patient: Yeah, I've been a smoker for a long time.
Doctor: We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed a right hilar mass with metastasis to the liver, right femur, and ribs. A biopsy revealed that you have small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Patient: Oh no, that's terrible.
Doctor: I understand this is difficult news, but it's important to address it. I've noticed that you've continued to smoke cigarettes even after the SCLC diagnosis. About two weeks later, you were admitted for acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to postobstructive pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and secondary pneumothorax. We managed these issues, and there was some improvement in your respiratory status.
Patient: Yeah, my breathing got a bit better after that.
Doctor: However, your PaCO2 and serum bicarbonate levels began to increase, with the bicarbonate level approaching up to 45 mEq/dl. This was associated with refractory hypokalemia and uncontrolled hypertension. We noticed metabolic alkalosis, which was chloride resistant, as your urine chloride was >20 mEq/dl. Your hyponatremia responded moderately to fluid restriction and gradually normalized after the onset of metabolic alkalosis.
Patient: So, what does that mean for me?
Doctor: Well, with uncontrolled hypertension and the presence of chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia, we decided to conduct a workup for hyperaldosteronism. Your serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity were within normal limits, so we proceeded with a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test.
Patient: What did the test show?
Doctor: The test revealed elevations of ACTH (319 pg/ml) and cortisol (131.5 μg/dl), consistent with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism and a condition called SAME, which is caused by an ectopic nonsuppressible source of ACTH. Furthermore, you've experienced significant weight loss of 28 pounds after your SCLC diagnosis and profound muscle wasting.
Patient: That's a lot to take in. What's next for me?
Doctor: We'll be working closely with you to create a personalized treatment plan to address both your SCLC and the metabolic issues. It's important to follow up with your medical team and monitor your symptoms. We'll do our best to support you through this process.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you were referred to us for management of fetal demise. Can you tell me about your antenatal visits and any symptoms you've experienced during your pregnancy?
Patient: Yes, I attended 3 antenatal visits at a health center. They documented my fundal height at each visit and gave me routine care. I had occasional painful fetal kicks, but I was otherwise well throughout the antenatal period.
Doctor: It's good that you had regular visits. When did you start to notice reduced fetal movements?
Patient: Hmm, about three days before I got admitted to your service, I noticed the reduced movements, so I consulted at the health center, and they said it was fetal demise.
Doctor: I see. When you were admitted to our unit, we checked your vital parameters and found them to be stable. There was no abdominal tenderness, and your fundal height was 32cm. Fetal parts were not easily palpable, and we couldn't perceive fetal heart tones. Also, there were no signs of per vaginal bleeding. Your cervix was long, posterior, firm, and closed. We requested an emergency ultrasound scan, which confirmed the fetal demise and showed gross cranial deformation. However, it didn't diagnose an intra-abdominal location.
Patient: That's really sad. So, what did you do next?
Doctor: We started cervical ripening with 50µg of misoprostol vaginally every 6 hours. After 4 applications, your cervix remained unchanged. So, we decided to proceed with operative delivery to avoid failed induction and reduce the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Patient: What did you find during the operation?
Doctor: The intraoperative findings showed a third-degree macerated female fetus floating freely in the peritoneal cavity, weighing 2650g with a tight cord round her neck, and there was no amniotic sac. The uterus was about 14 weeks, and the fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal. The placenta was implanted on the ascending colon and mesocolon. We decided to leave the placenta in place as there were no intraoperative complications encountered.
Patient: What treatment did I receive after the operation?
Doctor: Postoperatively, you were placed on ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole parenterally for five days to prevent infection. Additionally, you received 50mg of methotrexate every other day for 4 doses, along with 5mg of folinic acid each day following the methotrexate treatment.
Patient: When can I expect to be discharged?
Doctor: You were discharged on day 8 postoperation to continue your recovery at home.
Patient: Thank you for all the information and the care I received during this difficult time.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I'm here because I fell from a bunk bed nine days ago and I hurt my left wrist. I got it checked at another facility and they put a splint on it, but I wanted a second opinion.
Doctor: I see. Do you have a history of any other medical issues or injuries?
Patient: Hmm, well, I've had some issues with intravenous drug abuse and I've been incarcerated before.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Let's take a look at your wrist. I'll need to remove the splint and take new X-rays to assess the situation.
Patient: Sure, go ahead.
[Doctor takes X-rays]
Doctor: Your X-rays show that the fracture is highly comminuted, meaning there are many small, intra-articular fragments. To restore overall radiographic parameters and stability, we'll use ligamentotaxis with a 2.4/2.7 mm Synthes dorsal bridge plate. We'll also add percutaneously placed K wires for extra stabilization of the radial styloid and lunate facet.
Patient: Okay, so what does that involve?
Doctor: We'll make two incisions, one over the index metacarpal and one over the radial shaft. We won't open the third dorsal extensor compartment at the level of the wrist, which is a contrast to others' techniques. The plate will be placed deep to the extensor tendons in the proximal, radial shaft incision. We'll leave the K wire ends outside the skin to allow staged hardware removal without multiple trips to the operating room.
Patient: Got it. And after the procedure, what will my recovery look like?
Doctor: Postoperative X-rays will show improved radial inclination and articular congruity, with some residual slight dorsal tilt. You'll return for regular follow-up visits, and we'll remove the two K wires in the clinic about 4 weeks after surgery. At that point, you should be able to extend your thumb at the interphalangeal joint.
Patient: That sounds good. Is there anything else I should know?
Doctor: Plate removal will be discussed during your follow-up visits, but it's important to keep attending those appointments. In some cases, patients might experience sensations like clicking with wrist motion or difficulty extending their thumb. If that happens, we'll need to address it.
Patient: Okay, I'll make sure to come to my follow-up visits. Thank you for explaining everything to me.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been hospitalized for persistent aching pain in your abdomen and lower extremities for nearly 20 days. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, it's been really bothering me for the past 20 days, and I've also had severe hair loss for the past 10 days.
Doctor: I see. Let me ask you a few questions to better understand your situation. Have you had any significant health issues in the past?
Patient: No, I've been healthy and I haven't taken any medications.
Doctor: Alright. And is there any chance you might have been accidentally poisoned?
Patient: No, I don't think so.
Doctor: Okay, let's proceed with a physical examination. Hmm, I see that you have diffuse alopecia of the scalp. I also noticed that your liver function is damaged, with ALT at 154.8u/l and AST at 49.2 u/l. We've tested your urine mercury, hair arsenic, and blood lead levels, and they're all normal. 
Patient: Oh no, what could be causing this?
Doctor: We continued to monitor your condition, and your scalp hair was completely lost within a week. After further investigation, we've determined that you have thallium poisoning. This was confirmed by the elevated levels of thallium ion in your urine, which was 4677.0μg/l, and in your blood, which was 312.1μg/l. The normal range for urine is 5μg/l, and for blood, it's 0μg/l.
Patient: That's shocking! What can be done to treat this?
Doctor: We have started you on ten cycles of hemoperfusion and hemodialysis, each lasting for 5 to 6 hours daily. As these treatments were conducted, your blood and urine thallium levels have decreased.
Patient: That's a relief. Is there anything else being done for my treatment?
Doctor: Yes, after the hemoperfusion and hemodialysis, we've seen improvement in your neurological manifestations and liver function parameters. We've also given you Prussian blue 2.64 g, Q6h, forced diuresis, and 20 mmol potassium chloride twice a day, along with intravenous B complex.
Patient: How long will it take for my pain to subside and my hair to grow back?
Doctor: Your pain should disappear slowly, and your hair regrowth started 10 days later. It should be complete during your 6-month follow-up.

Patient: Yeah, it's gotten worse over the past three days. I can't do some simple tasks in everyday life and I've lost interest in the things I used to enjoy.
Doctor: I understand. Are you still able to do things like going to the supermarket and doing housework unsupervised?
Patient: Yes, I can still do those things independently.
Doctor: That's good to hear. I've also reviewed your medical history, and I see that you have dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, and you had a stroke at the age of 36 with mild right hemiparesis. Have you experienced any episodes of aphasia that could be considered as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)?

Patient: What about any issues with my arteries?
Doctor: We detected low-grade bilateral internal and external carotid artery stenosis on your carotid ultrasound.
Patient: And what about my brain? Did the imaging show anything?
Doctor: Yes, the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed communicating hydrocephalus, which is most likely due to brain atrophy and secondary brain changes. There was no obvious cause of obstruction in the ventricles. Your Huckman index was equal to 66, and the width of the third ventricle was equal to 10 mm.

Doctor: We immediately performed bloodwork upon your admission, which showed anemia with haemoglobin at 5.9 g/dL, hematocrit at 17.4%, and erythrocyte count at 2.07 million/uL. You also had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22,000/uL, but your thrombocyte level was normal at 358,000/uL.
Patient: So what was the treatment?
Doctor: We treated you with fluid resuscitation using both colloids and crystalloids, along with blood transfusion and uterotonics. We successfully performed a manual reposition of your uterus and applied internal bimanual compression for 15 minutes. However, you still had profuse hemorrhage due to uterine atony.
Patient: How did you manage that?
Doctor: We placed a balloon tamponade to stop the hemorrhage and reduce the risk of recurrence. Thankfully, your condition stabilized, and we didn't need to perform surgical management or a hysterectomy. We then repaired your perineal lacerations once the bleeding was under control.
Patient: I'm glad to hear that. How am I doing now?
Doctor: After transfusing 4 packed red cells, we repeated your bloodwork. Your hemoglobin is now at 10 g/dL, hematocrit at 29%, erythrocyte count at 3.66 million/uL, leucocyte count at 20,900/uL, and thrombocyte count at 159,000/uL. You have shown significant improvement.
Patient: That's a relief. What's next for me?
Doctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely. It is important to have follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to ensure your complete recovery.","S: The patient is a primigravid 24-year-old female referred to the emergency department from the community health center.

"Doctor: Hello, I am Dr. Johnson, and I will be taking care of you today. I understand that you were brought to the emergency department of our tertiary care referral hospital with a history of accidentally consuming car coolant and experiencing unsteadiness in your gait about 3 hours later. Can you tell me more about that?
Patient: Yes, doctor. I accidentally drank some car coolant and started feeling unsteady on my feet after about 3 hours.
Doctor: Thank you for the information. On examination, we observed that you were drowsy but following verbal commands. There was no odor of alcohol in your breath. Your GCS score was 15/15 (E4V5M6). Your blood pressure was 140/80 mm of Hg, and your pulse rate was 68 per minute. Oxygen saturation was maintained at room air. We also performed an ECG, which was normal, and no focal neurological deficit was detected. As a first line of treatment, we performed gastric lavage. We also conducted some laboratory investigations. 
Patient: Okay, doctor. What were the results of those investigations?
Doctor: Your lab results showed the following: Na+ was 142 mEq/L, K+ 2.4 mEq/L, Cl− 101.1 mEq/L, HCO3− 15.8 mEq/L, Ca+ 5 mg/dl, urea 35 mg/dl, creatinine 0.7 mg/dl, BUN 16.35 mg/dl, random glucose 141 mg/dl, and serum osmolality 323 mOsm/kg. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.322, pCO2 30.7 mmHg, pO2 93.8 mmHg, cBase(B)c −9.1. 
Patient: Oh, I see. What does all that mean?
Doctor: Also, your urine examination revealed crystals of calcium oxalate, which is a major indicator of ethylene glycol consumption. Your anion gap was 25.1 mEq/L, and the osmolar gap was 17 mOsm/kg·H2O. Unfortunately, we could not obtain blood and urine levels of ethylene glycol due to the lack of such analytical facilities in the region.
Patient: So, what's the plan for my treatment, doctor?
Doctor: Based on your lab results, we have confirmed a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. We have started you on oral ethanol therapy, which involves administering 2.5 ml/kg of 40% ethanol through a nasogastric tube. Additionally, due to the high anion gap metabolic acidosis, we will be giving you hemodialysis as part of your treatment.
Patient: Alright, doctor. Thank you for explaining everything to me.
Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your condition and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions or share any concerns you may have.

"Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you're a 33-year-old Japanese woman with a history of IgAN and diabetes mellitus. You've been admitted to our hospital for the initiation of insulin therapy and evaluation of persistent proteinuria. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: I understand that you had a renal biopsy for proteinuria back in 2009 and were diagnosed with IgAN at our hospital. At your current presentation, you have 0.7–1.0 g/day of urinary protein excretion without significant haematuria. Is that right?
Patient: Yes, that's what I've been told.
Doctor: Your mean blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, and you've been treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for IgAN with persistent proteinuria. Your urinary protein excretion levels have been about 0.5 g/day after the initiation of ARB. Two years later, you underwent a tonsillectomy for persistent proteinuria. Is that all correct?
Patient: Yes, that's correct.
Doctor: In 2012, you were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus based on your fasting plasma glucose levels and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels during regular visits. You were started on a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and Pioglitazone. However, one year later, you discontinued both the regular visits to our hospital and your medication. What was the reason for that?
Patient: I wasn't feeling well, and I thought I could manage it on my own.
Doctor: I see. Seven days prior to your admission at our hospital, you visited a clinic for fatigue. Your random blood glucose level was 375 mg/dL, and based on this result and persistent proteinuria, you were referred to our hospital. How are you feeling now?
Patient: I'm still feeling tired and a bit weak.
Doctor: Regarding your family history, your younger sister was diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance, and your maternal grandmother was diagnosed with diabetes. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: Your physical examination showed that you have a height of 147.0 cm and a weight of 46 kg, with a body mass index (BMI) of 21.3. We also found several abnormal values in your laboratory testing, including a random blood glucose level of 355 mg/dL, HbA1c level of 10.8%, and lactic acid level of 19.4 mg/dL. 
Patient: That sounds concerning.
Doctor: Yes, it's important to address these abnormal values. We'll be initiating insulin therapy to help manage your diabetes and monitoring your proteinuria closely. It's crucial to follow your prescribed treatment plan and attend regular visits to keep your diabetes and IgAN under control. 
Patient: Okay, I understand. I'll make sure to follow the treatment plan and attend regular visits this time.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you're here for an evaluation of your new-onset headaches that developed after coitus several weeks ago. Can you describe these headaches to me?
Patient: Yeah, they're really diffuse and have been bothering me for a while now.
Doctor: I see. We performed a fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture to help evaluate your condition. The initial pressure was 5 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 11.5 cm of H2O by fluid column method. We removed a total of 10 cc of clear CSF. The final pressure was 2 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 3.5 cm of H2O by fluid column method. After the puncture, did you experience any changes in your headache?
Patient: Yes, actually. I developed a different headache that got worse when I was upright.
Doctor: I understand. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe would you rate this new headache?
Patient: I'd say it was an 8 out of 10. It was really bad, and I also had nausea and vomiting.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems your headache was persistent for 4 days and didn't improve with steroids, caffeine infusion, or hydrocodone-acetaminophen treatment. We conducted a magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement to further assess your condition. The results showed cerebellar tonsils descending through the foramen magnum, slit ventricles, and enhancement of the dura. 
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: It's a significant finding, but we proceeded with an epidural injection of whole blood to address your symptoms. How did you feel after the procedure?

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come in for an outpatient consultation regarding painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy. Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this pain?
Patient: Yeah, I've been dealing with this pain for about 18 months now. It's been pretty bad.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, how would you rate your pain?
Patient: I'd say it's around a 7 or 8 out of 10.
Doctor: Have you found anything that helps relieve the pain?
Patient: Yes, I've been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and they seem to help.
Doctor: Good to know. Do you have any muscle contracture or pain when I press on the area?
Patient: No, I don't have any contracture, and it doesn't hurt when you press on it.
Doctor: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?
Patient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.
Doctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.
Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?
Doctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.
Patient: What can be done about it?
Doctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.
Patient: What should I expect during the surgery?
Doctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. We'll use a new all-in-one imaging device called Surgivisio® to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional (2D) mode. This machine is a 2D/3D C-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. We'll perform a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels.
Patient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. I feel more comfortable knowing what to expect.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you're a 67-year-old man with Lynch syndrome (MSH6 mutation) and polycythemia vera. What brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I've been diagnosed with MCC and I'm not sure about my Merkel cell polyomavirus status. It's been tough lately.
Doctor: I understand. Your records show that you have histologically-proven MCC metastatic to the liver. We started you on first-line therapy with pembrolizumab for 2 months, but unfortunately, you had progressive disease (PD) as your best response. (Fig.)
Patient: Yeah, that's right. I was then treated with something else, I think it was ipilimumab and nivolumab.
Doctor: Yes, you were treated with four cycles of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4, 3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1, 1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks × 4. You experienced a partial response per immune-related response criteria, which lasted 30 weeks before your disease progressed again.
Patient: I remember that. But those medications were given to me again, right?
Doctor: Correct. Ipilimumab and nivolumab were administered again, but they resulted in PD at 14 weeks. After that, we decided to try a different approach.
Patient: That's when I started receiving avelumab and radiotherapy, right?
Doctor: Yes, you were given avelumab (anti-PD-L1) 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 3D conformal radiation therapy, 2500 centigray, to a right iliac mass. This treatment resulted in a partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1.
Patient: I remember feeling better after that.
Doctor: Indeed, there was marked regression in the irradiated tumor (Fig.), and your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status improved from 2 to 0. Your partial response lasted 12 months.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've been admitted to Queens Hospital Center with a complaint of shortness of breath for two days duration. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?
Patient: Yeah, I've been noticing a decrease in my exercise tolerance for a few weeks now. And two weeks ago, I was admitted here for chest pain, but they ruled out acute coronary syndrome.
Doctor: I see. Based on your evaluation, you had tachycardia with a heart rate of 120-124/min and blood pressure of 110/80 mm Hg. Your lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of infection or blood loss. We started you on anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism. Do you remember if you had a CT chest done?
Patient: No, they didn't do a CT chest initially because my creatinine was elevated at 1.6.
Doctor: Right, so instead they did a ventilation/perfusion scan, or V/Q scan, which showed intermediate probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. We decided to continue your anticoagulation. However, you still had persistent tachycardia, and blood tests showed hypocalcemia at 6.8-7.9 mg/dL and hypokalemia at 3.2-3.4 mEQ/L, but your thyroid function was normal.
Patient: Oh, I didn't know that.
Doctor: We also found that your 25-hydroxyvitamin D test was low at 6 ng/ml, and your intact parathyroid hormone was elevated at 85.1 pg/ml. As a result, we put you on metoprolol 50 mg twice daily and continued intravenous hydration with electrolyte supplementation. We eventually did a CT chest which confirmed the presence of old embolism and showed a 1.1 cm nodule in your left upper lobe.
Patient: So, what's the plan now?
Doctor: We've consulted endocrinology for your persistent tachycardia with relatively stable blood pressure. You also had spikes of temperature for two days, so we started you on Tamiflu and Rocephin while waiting for blood culture results.
Patient: Okay, I understand. But I really want to be discharged and go home.
Doctor: I understand, but we need to monitor your condition closely. Unfortunately, you suddenly collapsed and went into cardiorespiratory failure. We had to intubate you and transfer you to the intensive care unit for further management.
Patient's Family: What happened after that?
Doctor: We attempted to resuscitate him in the ICU, but sadly, our efforts were futile. I'm very sorry for your loss.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you were admitted to our hospital last month with left quadrant abdominal pain and weight loss for more than 6 months. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, the pain gets worse after eating, and I also experience abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus.
Doctor: Have you tried any treatments for these symptoms before coming here?
Patient: I was taking some traditional Chinese medicine that temporarily relieved the symptoms.
Doctor: I see. Do you have any medical history we should know about?
Patient: Yes, I have a history of hypertension, but my control has been poor.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. It looks like you underwent a colonoscopy examination in a local hospital. What were the results of that examination?
Patient: They verbally reported no pathologic findings.
Doctor: Alright, during your physical examination here, we found mesogastric tenderness and an enlarged spleen. Your blood laboratory examination reported only mild hypokalemia, and your urinary and stool reports were normal. Enhanced computerized tomography showed splenomegaly, jejunal wall edema, narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema, atrophy of the right liver lobe, hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, calcification, and periportal fibrosis. These signs are compatible with hepatic schistosomiasis.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it is a condition that needs attention. During the double balloon enteroscopy, we noticed that your blood pressure was not stable, so we couldn't reexamine the colon. The upper enteroscopy showed an ulcer 150 cm distal to the Treitz ligament, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The ulcer had a white coating and peripheral mucosal hyperemia, occupying 2/3 of the lumen, making it difficult for the endoscope to pass through. We took four biopsies from the ulcer, and 20 cm proximal from the ulcer, we found many scattered irregular ulcers, from which we took two biopsies.
Patient: What did the histopathological examination reveal?
Doctor: The examination reported chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old S. japonicum eggs deposition.
Patient: What treatment did I receive during my hospitalization?
Doctor: You received symptomatic treatment with intravenous fluids, electrolytes, antispasmodic medication, and proton-pump inhibitors.
Patient: I remember now. Unfortunately, I had to request a voluntary discharge from the hospital and decided to continue my treatment and follow-up at a local hospital.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been referred to our hospital due to a mass that was incidentally discovered in your right kidney. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: The mass is 16-mm in size and located in the anterior medial position of your kidney. We performed a renal biopsy, which confirmed that it's renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer.
Patient: Oh no, that's terrible.
Doctor: I understand your concern. We have a treatment plan to address this issue. We placed a hook wire in the tumor with the help of an interventional radiologist and CT guidance.
Patient: What's the purpose of that?
Doctor: The hook wire helps us localize the tumor during surgery. It's a technique we use for nonpalpable breast lesions to facilitate intraoperative localization. We will perform a partial nephrectomy to remove the tumor.
Patient: How does the surgery work?
Doctor: You will be placed in a modified left lateral decubitus position, and we will establish pneumoperitoneum. Trocars will be placed to access your abdomen. We will mobilize your bowel medially and develop the plane between the anterior Gerota's fascia and the posterior mesocolon.
Patient: Okay, and then?
Doctor: Your kidney will be mobilized within Gerota's fascia. We will locate the hook wire and clamp the renal artery with a bulldog. The renal capsule will be resected using scissors under warm ischemia, which will take about 25 minutes.
Patient: How will you stop the bleeding?
Doctor: Hemostasis will be achieved using a combination of cautery, hemostatic agents, and suturing. We will use sutures preloaded with clips to secure a suture line, allowing for lateral compression perpendicular to the renal capsule.
Patient: What will the results be like?
Doctor: The histopathology report confirmed clear-cell renal carcinoma with negative surgical margins. According to the TNM 2017 classification, it's stage pT1a.
Patient: What does that mean for me?
Doctor: It means that the cancer is in its early stage and we were able to remove it completely.

"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you've been suffering from HCC with multiple lung metastases for the past 3 months. You're a hepatitis B carrier, correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right.
Doctor: I see that you were admitted complaining of a headache. We performed a brain MRI scan to check for any brain metastasis. The results showed a solid mass occupying your left nasal cavity, measuring 3.7 × 1.8 × 2.8 cm.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Yes, the mass showed iso-signal intensity on the T1 weighted image, high signal intensity on the T2 weighted image, and heterogeneous well enhancement on the Gd-T1 weighted image. Gradient-echo images also showed small foci of low signal, suggesting haemorrhage in the mass.
Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?
Doctor: This means that there might be bleeding within the mass. We didn't find any restricted diffusion in the mass on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Metastasis of HCC was suggested, as your nasal cavity was normal on a positron emission tomography CT scan that had been performed 3 months ago.
Patient: I see. I have developed some symptoms like left nasal obstruction, clear rhinorrhea, and left facial pain.
Doctor: Those symptoms are consistent with the mass in your nasal cavity. We performed an excisional biopsy with a CT scan 17 days after the MRI scan. It showed that the mass had rapidly increased in size to 6.2 × 2.2 × 3.4 cm, with involvement of the ostium of the nasolacrimal duct and the lateral wall of the anterior nasal cavity.
Patient: Wow, that's a big change.
Doctor: Yes, it is. There was no calcification in the mass on the pre-contrast CT scan. We conducted a punch biopsy and the histological examination revealed tumor cells with enlarged nucleoli and clear cytoplasm arranged in trabecular cords and glandular arrays, consistent with metastatic HCC.
Patient: So, what's the grade of the tumor?
Doctor: The tumor is grade 2, which means it's moderately differentiated. We were planning for a resection of the tumor, but unfortunately, your general condition has declined.
Patient: Oh no, what's going to happen now?
Doctor: Due to your location and your current condition, we're going to transfer you to another hospital for further treatment and care.
Patient: I understand. Thank you for the information and your help, doctor.","S: The patient is a hepatitis B carrier with multiple lung metastases for the past 3 months.

"Doctor: Hi, I'm Dr. Smith, the specialist you were referred to by your primary care physician. Can you tell me about the problem you've been experiencing?
Patient: Hello, Dr. Smith. My primary care doctor noticed that my tonsils were enlarged during an examination of my oral cavity. The right one is slightly larger than the left, but there wasn't any surface abnormality.
Doctor: I see. And did your doctor prescribe any medication for it?
Patient: Yes, they prescribed me two courses of amoxicillin, but it didn't help me improve.
Doctor: Alright. I've reviewed your medical history and it seems to be unremarkable. We also did not find any cervical lymphadenopathy, significant systemic symptoms, malignancy, or immunocompromise. Your laboratory parameters were within normal limits as well.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: We conducted a Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging test to look for any mass lesions in your tonsils, but no obvious mass was found. However, the images did show that the right tonsil is larger than the left.
Patient: Hmm, okay.
Doctor: On the axial T2-weighted image and postgadolinium T1-weighted image with fat saturation, we did not find any mass in the right tonsil. The left tonsil showed mucosal crypts with linear enhancement, but on the right side, the crypts were partly obliterated by a large mass and did not display enhancement.
Patient: Oh, I see.
Doctor: Due to the possibility of malignancy, we decided to perform a complete surgical resection of the right tonsil.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: The surgery was successful. The histological examination of the specimen revealed diffuse sheets of monomorphous plasmacytoid cells with abundant eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. We also observed occasional binucleated and pleomorphic cells with giant nuclei and prominent nucleoli, as well as mitotic figures.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: These findings indicate that there is no amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemically, the plasma cells were diffusely immunoreactive for λ light chain and IgG. This means that the cells are producing a specific type of antibody, but it's not a sign of malignancy.
Patient: Oh, that's a relief.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Now that the surgery is complete, we will continue to monitor your recovery and ensure that there are no further issues. Please follow the post-surgery care instructions and contact us if you have any concerns.

"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Hi, I've got some redness in my right eye and I saw a worm moving in my left eye.
Doctor: I see. Have you had any exposure to rural streams during your childhood?
Patient: Yes, I used to play in them when I was a kid.
Doctor: Alright, let's perform an ocular examination to check your visual acuity and look for any other findings. 
*After examination*
Doctor: Your visual acuity is 6/5 in both eyes, which is normal. I found a temporal subconjunctival hemorrhage in your right eye, but the worm in your left eye is no longer present.
Patient: Oh, okay.
Doctor: I'll reassure you that this is not a major issue. However, if you see the worm again, please come back to the clinic.
Patient: Sure, thanks.
*Eleven months later*
Patient: Hi again, I saw the worm in my left eye and I've been experiencing recurrent redness and a feeling of something moving in that eye. I also have generalized body itching, which gets worse at night.
Doctor: Alright, let's examine your eye again.
*After examination*
Doctor: I found a mobile worm in the temporal subconjunctival area of your left eye, which soon migrated to the superior bulbar conjunctiva.
Patient: Oh no, what do we do?
Doctor: We will perform a conjunctival incision to extract the worm using forceps and repair the wound.
*After the procedure*
Doctor: The worm has been successfully removed. Histology confirmed it as an adult Loa loa. We've also done a blood work up, which showed negative results for microfilaria but positive eosinophilia at 44.4%.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means that there's an elevated level of eosinophils in your blood, which can be associated with a parasitic infection. We will treat you with oral Albendazole to address this issue.

"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I. You were admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology service for a planned transvaginal hysterectomy. Can you tell me more about your medical history and any current symptoms you're experiencing?
Patient: Hi, Doctor. I don't have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.
Doctor: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ng/ml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilson's disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.
Patient: Yeah, that's right. I also remember that my α-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg/dl.
Doctor: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, you've been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.
Patient: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?
Doctor: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93%. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.
Patient: That's good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.
Doctor: Yes, on postoperative day two, you became dyspneic while walking to the restroom. We also noted a two-gram drop in your hemoglobin level after surgery, which was promptly corrected with two units of packed red blood cells.
Patient: Oh, I see. Did that help with my shortness of breath?
Doctor: Unfortunately, despite the administration of packed red blood cell transfusions, you still experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation. When you tried to ambulate further, you developed perioral cyanosis.
Patient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good. What should I do now, Doctor?
Doctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and provide necessary medical support. It's important that you report any new or worsening symptoms immediately. We will work together to ensure your recovery and to manage your various health conditions.
Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.","S: The patient is a 68-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, newly-diagnosed liver cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you were referred to our Veterinary Teaching Hospital at CEU Cardenal Herrera University because your French bulldog has a corneal mass on the right eye that has been enlarging over a 2-month period. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. He's a 7-year-old male and had a complete excision of the third eyelid gland 5 years ago.
Doctor: I see. And did he develop any complications after that surgery?
Patient: Yes, he developed keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which we've been controlling with cyclosporine eye drops and artificial tears.
Doctor: That's good to hear. Now, let's proceed with the examination. I noticed an exophytic pink to white gelatinous mass occupying about 70% of the central cornea on his right eye (Fig. a). His dazzle reflex seems inconsistent, and his menace response is negative. I'll perform a fluorescein staining to check for any corneal damage.
Patient: Alright, what did you find?
Doctor: The fluorescein staining was negative. I also conducted a slit lamp biomicroscopy examination, which showed a severe increase in corneal thickness, pigment deposit, and superficial vascularization. The mass seems to be infiltrating the corneal stroma.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed a Schirmer tear test-1 and measured the intraocular pressure by applanation tonometry. Both of these tests were within normal limits. However, we couldn't perform an indirect ophthalmoscopy.
Patient: And what about his left eye?
Doctor: The ophthalmic exam of the left eye was unremarkable, and no abnormalities were observed on the physical examination.
Patient: So, what's the diagnosis for his right eye?
Doctor: At this time, we suspect it may be corneal neoplasia. Other differential diagnoses include granulation tissue and a chronic inflammatory process. To confirm the diagnosis, we performed an excisional superficial keratectomy under general anesthesia.
Patient: What did you find from that procedure?
Doctor: The histological findings were consistent with corneal carcinoma. We proceeded with transconjunctival enucleation to remove the mass.
Patient: And what happens after that?
Doctor: We have fixed the globe, conjunctiva, and nictitant membrane in 10% neutral buffered formalin and submitted it for histopathologic examination. We'll be able to provide more information once we have the results.

"Doctor: Hello, I see from your history that you have osteoarthritis and hypothyroidism. What brings you in today?
Patient: Hi, doc. I noticed a rapidly growing lesion near my left eye about 3 weeks ago, and it's been growing ever since. My primary care physician referred me to you.
Doctor: I see. Let's take a look at the lesion. Upon examination, it appears to be a medial orbital mass causing ectropion of the lower eyelid and symptomatic epiphora. We should perform a CT scan of the orbits to further investigate this lesion.
Patient: Alright, doc. What did the CT scan results show?
Doctor: The CT scan showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.0 cm nonenhancing intraorbital soft tissue lesion abutting the nasal lacrimal duct, lateral and inferior to the globe, without definite osseous remodeling. There is no thickening of the lateral rectus muscle or inflammation. There is a moderate lateral displacement of the intraocular structures, but the globe is intact.
Patient: Oh, I see. What's the next step, doc?
Doctor: We performed an anterior orbitotomy with biopsy 4 days after your presentation. The pathology was initially read as positive for intermediate grade epithelioid carcinoma, but after an outside consultation, the diagnosis was edited to epithelioid sarcoma with rhabdoid features (proximal type).
Patient: What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: Immunohistochemical stains revealed the tumor to be AE1/AE3 strong positive, GATA3 strong positive, vimentin strong positive, EMA focal positive, calponin focal positive, and a series of other markers were negative. This helps us better understand the nature of the tumor.
Patient: Considering my age and the tumor's histology, what are my treatment options?
Doctor: Due to your age and the tumor histology, chemotherapy is not recommended by medical oncology. We completed your staging workup with a soft tissue neck CT, which showed no evidence of abnormal lymph nodes. Additionally, a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT showed no evidence of metastatic disease in your chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Thus, the disease is localized to the left orbit only.
Patient: That's somewhat relieving. What's the plan moving forward?
Doctor: We will closely monitor the lesion and discuss other treatment options with you as needed. It's important to keep an eye on any changes and report them to us immediately.
Patient: Okay, doc. I'll keep a close watch on it and let you know if there are any changes. Thank you for your help.
Doctor: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. Take care.","S: The patient, with a history of osteoarthritis and hypothyroidism, presented with a rapidly growing lesion near the left eye 3 weeks ago.

"Doctor: Hello, I understand you have a history of multiple periprosthetic infections in your left knee. Can you tell me more about your past medical history?
Patient: Yeah, I have diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
Patient: Yes, I had a lumbar spinal fusion and multiple failed revision two-stage TKAs for my knee infection.
Doctor: I see. Are you currently taking any medications for your conditions?
Patient: Yes, I'm taking furosemide, gabapentin, carvedilol, lansoprazole, docusate, and enalapril.
Doctor: Good to know. Do you have any documented history of allergies or complications with anesthesia?
Patient: No, I don't.
Doctor: On the day of your operation, we administered cephalexin 2 mg. When we opened your left knee, we found cloudy fluid, which was sent for culture and sensitivities. We debrided and irrigated the infected cement spacers on your femur and tibia. A tobramycin and vancomycin cement mixture formed the new spacer. Intraoperatively, you had brief episodes of hypotension on induction, requiring 3 pressors.
Patient: Oh, I didn't know that.
Doctor: For the duration of the case, you required intermittent pressure support with a total of phenylephrine 360 mcg, epinephrine 30 mcg, and norepinephrine 36 mcg. After the surgery, you were extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
Patient: That's good to hear.
Doctor: Your medications postoperatively included celecoxib 200 mg BID and aspirin 325 mg BID, and we continued you on lansoprazole. We also started you on vancomycin 2 g IV every 12 hours and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 6 hours.
Patient: Okay, got it.
Doctor: The cultures revealed that your joint was infected with Corynebacterium striatum, so we discontinued the IV piperacillin-tazobactam.

"Doctor: Hi, I see that you were admitted after experiencing a sudden thunderclap headache, preceded by an acute loss of consciousness at your home. Is that correct?
Patient: Yes, that's right. It happened so suddenly.
Doctor: I understand. Were there any past history of hypertension, seizures, drug abuse, trauma, or infection before this incident?
Patient: No, I never had any of those issues.
Doctor: Okay. On admission, our initial clinical examination showed you were unconscious with a GCS score of 10/15, which corresponds to Hunt & Hess classification Grade IV.
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: After we stabilized you, we performed a CT scan, which showed diffuse subarachnoid haemorrhage and a cisternal clot at the interpeduncular cistern. This is classified as Modified Fisher I. We also noticed moderate dilatation of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricle.
Patient: What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: It means that you had bleeding in the space around your brain and a clot formed in a specific area. The dilatation of the temporal horns indicates some swelling in your brain. We then performed an angiography to further investigate the cause.
Patient: And what did the angiography show?
Doctor: The angiography revealed a ruptured saccular aneurysm of less than 3 mm in diameter, with a neck of 1.5 mm at the origin of your left frontopolar artery. Considering the small size of the aneurysm and its ruptured nature, we decided to manage it conservatively.
Patient: I see. But I heard that it bled again after 2 weeks?
Doctor: Yes, unfortunately, the aneurysm bled once more. We obtained another CT scan, which showed a superior interhemispheric frontal haematoma that had opened to your ventricular system. This was classified as Modified Fisher IV.
Patient: What did you do then?
Doctor: On Day 15 after the second haemorrhage, we performed a coiling procedure. After selectively placing a microcatheter in the left frontopolar artery aneurysm, we completely obliterated it with a single coil, maintaining the distal arterial lumen totally permeable.
Patient: Did the procedure work?
Doctor: Yes, it did. We performed a follow-up magnetic resonant angiogram 6 months after the coil embolization, and it showed stable occlusion.
Patient: That's good to hear. But recently, I had an episode of GTCS. What happened?

"Doctor: Hi, I understand that you're 32 years old and currently at week 22 of your pregnancy. You were admitted to the haematology department with bilateral supraclavicular swelling, diffuse itching, and right shoulder pain. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yes, I've been experiencing these swellings on both sides of my neck, and they've been very itchy. My right shoulder has been hurting a lot too.
Doctor: Alright, we performed an ultrasound imaging and found pathological bilateral supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes. After a biopsy, we diagnosed you with nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).
Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.
Doctor: It is a type of cancer, but don't worry. We will do our best to help you. We also performed a fetal ultrasound screening and it showed that your baby is developing normally.
Patient: That's a relief. What's the plan for my treatment?
Doctor: We decided not to perform a combined fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan before delivery due to the risk of radiation exposure during pregnancy. Instead, we used ultrasound and whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) to stage the disease. It showed right cervical, bilateral supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph node involvement without a bulky mass, indicating Stage IIA disease according to Ann Arbor classification.
Patient: What does that mean?
Doctor: It means the cancer is in the early stages and has not spread extensively. The multidisciplinary team, including haematologists, gynaecologists, radiologists, and neonatologists, decided to start chemotherapy only if clinically necessary. We have been following up with ultrasound, WB-MRI, haematology consults, and gynaecological examinations. We also started therapy with steroid and paracetamol to slow down the progression of the disease and treat your itching and shoulder pain.
Patient: Hmm, okay. And how's my condition now?
Doctor: At pregnancy week 27, WB-MRI demonstrated a slight progression of the disease, seen as an enlargement of the lymph node packages, with the largest in the mediastinum having an axial diameter of 5.4 x 4.5 cm.
Patient: Oh no, what do we do now?
Doctor: Unfortunately, at pregnancy week 29, your clinical conditions got worse, and you presented with coughing, night sweating, numbness, and pain radiating across the shoulder down the arm. An ultrasound examination showed enlargement of a right axillary lymph node and internal jugular vein thrombosis. We treated the thrombosis with enoxaparin, which allowed complete recanalization in just a week. Due to these symptoms and findings, the team decided to start chemotherapy.
Patient: I see. So, what's the next step?
Doctor: We'll perform another WB-MRI to monitor the progression of the disease and ensure the chemotherapy is working effectively. We'll continue with the multidisciplinary follow-up and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to ensure the best possible outcome for both you and your baby.

"Doctor: Hello, I see you've presented with a one-month history of epigastric discomfort. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Yeah, I've been having this discomfort in my upper stomach area for the past month. It's been quite bothersome.
Doctor: I understand. We performed a physical examination, and it was unremarkable. However, your laboratory examination showed slightly elevated amylase levels. We conducted an abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and found a low-density mass with a diameter of 30 mm at the pancreatic head, with segmental superior mesenteric vein (SMV) attachment. There was neither stenosis nor arteriosclerosis around the celiac axis at that time.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: We also performed endoscopic ultrasonography, and a fine-needle biopsy sample showed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
Patient: So, it's cancer?
Doctor: Yes, unfortunately. We proceeded with pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with superior mesenteric vein resection and reconstruction. Additionally, a lymphadenectomy including right half dissection of the lymph nodes was performed without the nerve plexus around the celiac trunk. Intraoperative exploration ruled out latent peritoneal or liver metastasis and showed normal anatomy of the celiac trunk, mesenteric vessels, and related branches.
Patient: How did the surgery go?
Doctor: The duration of the surgery was 549 minutes, and the blood loss was 863 mL. Blood transfusion was not performed. We had to mobilize the pancreatic body more than usual for the pancreaticojejunostomy because it was a hard pancreas.
Patient: What happened after the surgery?
Doctor: On postoperative day 3, your liver function tests were still abnormal, and we found bloody fluids in the drain. An abdominal CT showed a characteristic hook-pattern on the anterior proximal celiac axis from compression of the MAL, which had not been detected in the preoperative CT. Ischemic changes in the remnant pancreas, hepatic lateral segment, and gastrojejunostomy site were also observed.
Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?
Doctor: Although all celiac branches were visible, there were almost no pulsations in those branches. We first tried interventional radiology, but the procedure failed due to tight compression against the outside of the celiac axis.
Patient: So, what was the next step?
Doctor: You underwent an urgent re-laparotomy to address the issue. I'll be monitoring your progress closely and provide further instructions based on your recovery.

Patient: Hi, I've had a mass on my anterior abdominal wall for about a year now. It's been gradually increasing in size and causing me discomfort.
Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in the mass or your symptoms during certain times, such as during your menstrual cycle?
Patient: Yes, it gets worse during my menses. The mass seems to get bigger and the pain becomes more intense.
Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Have you had any surgeries in the past, specifically in the abdominal area?
Patient: I had a caesarean section six years ago, but that's it.
Doctor: Alright. I would like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of the mass. 
Patient: Sure, go ahead.
Doctor: *Examines the patient* I can feel a circumscribed mass measuring approximately 6 cms in diameter in the infraumbilical region to the left of the midline. The mobility of the swelling seems to be restricted when you contract your muscles, which may suggest infiltration of the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures.
Patient: What does that mean, exactly?
Doctor: It means the mass may be affecting the muscles and tissues beneath the skin. We will need to conduct some laboratory investigations and a CT scan to get a clearer picture. 
Patient: Okay, let's do it.
*After the tests*
Doctor: The laboratory results are within normal limits, and the CT scan revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion in the subcutaneous tissues, infiltrating the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures. This is highly suggestive of an abdominal wall endometrioma.
Patient: So, what's the next step for me?
Doctor: The best course of action would be surgical resection. We would remove the endometrioma along with a portion of the underlying aponeurosis and rectus abdominis muscle.
Patient: And after that?
Doctor: We will place a polypropylene mesh over the defect created by the resection and fix it to the anterior rectus sheath with nonabsorbable sutures. This will help to reinforce the area and promote healing.
Patient: What can I expect after the surgery?
Doctor: The postoperative course should be uneventful. We will perform a histopathological evaluation of the resected specimen to ensure clear resection margins. Following the procedure, there should be no seroma at the operative site, and you should experience complete relief of symptoms.
Patient: That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor.
Doctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help.","S: The patient reports experiencing a circumscribed mass measuring approximately 6 cms in diameter in the infraumbilical region to the left of the midline.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?
Patient: Yes, I have hypertension, diverticulosis, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, and I use alcohol daily.
Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What brings you to the emergency department today?
Patient: I've had hiccups for a week now, along with a few episodes of nonbloody and nonbilious emesis. I don't have chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea.
Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications?
Patient: No, I'm not taking any medications.
Doctor: Have you had any prior history of palpitations, syncope, or seizures?
Patient: No, I don't have any prior history of those.
Doctor: Is there any significant family medical history that I should be aware of?
Patient: There's no known significant family medical history.
Doctor: Alright. Your triage vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 114, respiratory rate of 18, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The physical examination shows dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. We'll give you a 1-liter bolus of intravenous normal saline and 25 mg of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) by mouth to help with the hiccups.
Patient: Okay, thank you.
[15-20 minutes later]
Doctor: I'm afraid we've encountered a serious issue. After receiving the chlorpromazine, you went into cardiac arrest. We initiated advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) interventions immediately. Your initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, requiring four defibrillations at 200 joules each. We also observed Torsades de pointes and administered 2 grams of intravenous magnesium.
Patient: Oh my, that's concerning.
Doctor: Yes, it is. Your post-arrest ECGs show normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 98-99, but your QTc is between 495-521 ms, which is longer than the normal QTc of <440 ms in men. An arterial blood gas test showed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22 (normal range is 7.38–7.42), a lactate level of 14 mmol/L (normal range is 0.60–2.40), and an ionized calcium level of 1.12 mmol/L (normal range is 1.10–1.33). We'll need to perform a comprehensive metabolic panel to investigate further.
Patient: I understand, please do what's necessary.
Doctor: We'll keep you closely monitored and inform you of any updates. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help.","S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, diverticulosis, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, and alcohol daily, presents with a history of hiccups for a week, nonbloody and nonbilious emesis, chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea.

"Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your medical history, especially regarding alcohol and tobacco use?
Patient: I've been using alcohol and tobacco extensively for many years.
Doctor: I see. What brings you in today?
Patient: For the past 2 months, I've had this progressively enlarging, painful ulcerative lesion in the middle of my tongue. It's about 5 cm and has even caused an anterior tongue cleft. I've also had unintentional weight loss, left ear pain, and swelling under my jaw.
Doctor: Hmm, have you noticed any lumps in your neck area?
Patient: Yes, I've felt some non-tender lumps on both sides of my neck.
Doctor: It seems you have bilateral palpable lymphadenopathy in levels I, II, and III. Now, I understand you've had biopsies done before by an otolaryngologist. What were the results?
Patient: They didn't find any cancer, but they saw some reactive inflammatory changes.
Doctor: Okay. We also conducted a positron emission tomography scan, which revealed hypermetabolic lesions in your anterior tongue and lymph nodes, suggesting malignancy. The assessment was a likely T3/4N2cM0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma. We performed a panendoscopy with biopsies and a physical examination under anesthesia for surgical planning. However, the biopsy results again did not show carcinoma but rather granulomatous inflammation without organisms present.
Patient: So, what's the next step?
Doctor: A multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a rheumatologic workup and an excisional lymph node biopsy. The lymph node biopsy results demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with no malignancy, while laboratory results showed markedly elevated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels. These findings suggested an atypical case of sarcoidosis, so we referred you for a pulmonary consultation.
Patient: I remember that. I also developed some red spots on my extremities, palms, soles, and trunk.
Doctor: Yes, your laboratory evaluation demonstrated T pallidum immunoglobulin G antibodies present with a reflex RPR titer of 1:512. We then analyzed the lymph node biopsy sample with immunohistochemistry (IHC), which revealed spirochetes. You were diagnosed with tertiary syphilis and started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days due to a severe penicillin allergy.
Patient: How am I doing after the treatment?
Doctor: After receiving treatment, your tongue lesion is healing well, but there is still a persistent anterior tongue cleft. It is important for you to follow up with further laboratory evaluations to monitor your progress.
Patient: Alright, I'll make sure to do that. Thank you, Doctor.","S: The patient reports a history of progressively enlarging, painful ulcerative lesion in the middle of the tongue, causing an anterior tongue cleft, unintentional weight loss, left ear pain, and swelling under the jaw.

"Patient: Hi doctor, I've been having some issues lately and I'm not sure what's going on.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
Patient: Well, I've been experiencing urinary frequency and nocturia for about a month now.
Doctor: I see. Let's discuss your medical history to better understand your situation. I know you have multiple psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and poor impulse control. What medications are you currently taking?
Patient: I'm taking clonidine 0.1 mg three times daily, guanfacine 4 mg daily, bupropion sustained-release 150 mg daily, quetiapine 200 mg twice daily, and lithium 450 mg three times daily. I started lithium when I was 5 years old.
Doctor: Thank you for that information. About a year prior to your presentation, your lithium level was in the range of 0.9–1.1 mmol/L and your serum creatinine was 0.78 mg/dL, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 86 ml/min/1.73 m2 based on the bedside Schwartz formula. We'll need to run some tests to identify any issues.
[After running tests]
Doctor: Your physical examination was unremarkable. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.006, a pH of 6.0, but no hematuria or proteinuria. Blood tests showed a lithium level of 1.4 mmol/L, a TSH of 5.09 uIU/mL (normal 0.55–4.78 uIU/mL), a calcium of 11.1 mg/dL (normal 8.6–10.6 mg/dL), and a creatinine of 1.15 mg/dL.
Patient: Is there anything we should do about it?
Doctor: Your primary care physician (PCP) reduced your lithium dose to 450 mg twice daily and initiated levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. One week later, your lithium level reduced to 1.1 mmol/L. However, over the next couple of weeks, your creatinine increased to 1.3 mg/dL.
Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.
Doctor: Your PCP decided to discontinue the lithium by tapering the dose over the next 3 weeks. Despite a very low lithium level of <0.1 mmol/L four weeks after discontinuation, your serum creatinine continued to increase, prompting a nephrology referral.
Patient: So, what happens now?
Doctor: At your presentation to the nephrology clinic, your physical examination was unremarkable. The nephrologist will further evaluate your condition and determine the best course of action for your treatment.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help in figuring this out.","S: The patient reports experiencing urinary frequency and nocturia for about a month.
