# Using Language Models for Generating Patient Clinical Letters  

## Overview  

This project explores the feasibility of using language models (LMs) to generate patient clinical letters while optimizing computational efficiency and ensuring data privacy.  

## Objectives  

- **Automate Clinical Letter Generation**: Evaluate LMs' capability to produce accurate and coherent clinical letters.  
- **Reduce Computational Requirements**: Implement optimization techniques or lightweight models to improve efficiency.  
- **Ensure Data Privacy**: Apply privacy-preserving methods to comply with healthcare regulations and protect patient data.  
- **Enhance Workflow Efficiency**: Streamline clinical documentation for healthcare professionals.  

## Features  

- üìÑ **Automated Letter Drafting** ‚Äì Generate structured clinical letters efficiently.  
- üîí **Privacy-Focused** ‚Äì Ensure compliance with data protection standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).  
- ‚ö° **Optimized for Performance** ‚Äì Reduce computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy.  
- üè• **Healthcare Integration** ‚Äì Adaptable for electronic health record (EHR) systems.
